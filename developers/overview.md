# Overview

## Integration Options

Mindset provides two modes of integration:

* [Mindset API](mindset-api/)&#x20;
* [Embed SDK](embed-sdk/) (embedding Mindset AI agents on webpages)

All of the UI configuration is handled through the [Mindset Platform](broken-reference).





You will need to set up a Mindset Application and have obtained an API key. Please [contact support](../support/contacting-support.md) if you have not done this yet, and we will help you get started.
