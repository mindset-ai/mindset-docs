## Get Started with Embedding a Mindset agent&#x20;

You can embed your Mindset agent into a web page you are building for your users.

Typically this will form part of a range of resources you make available to specific people - students studying certain courses, team members in a particular group.

Identifying the user and controlling access to the agent, and the knowledge it has access to, is in the control of your site.

All of the UI configuration is handled through the [Mindset Platform](broken-reference).
