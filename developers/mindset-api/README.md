# Mindset API

Mindset provides two API protocols which achieve the same objective. The protocol choice is up to you based on your personal or project preferences.

* gRPC API
* REST API

If you are familiar with [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), then this is the preferred approach. If you are more comfortable with [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST), Mindset fully supports this.&#x20;
