# Mindset Public APIs

**Ingestion API (coming soon)**

* allows ingestion of content from external sources into knowledge banks

The key benefit will be for customers to have more control over when they want to send us content rather than waiting for the ingestion cycles scheduled by us.

**Agent APIs (coming soon)**

As part of Agent API, Mindset's customers will be able to integrate agent features into their own platforms.

Agent APIs will enable you to do the following:

* system authentication (allowing integration into pre-built platforms)
* user authentication (enabling integration into custom-build platforms)
* ability to chat to an agent
* thread management
* content reference features (eg citations)
* capabilities access

Once the full scope of Agent API is delivered, we hope that our customers will be able to easily choose which elements of agents functionality they want to integrate into their platforms. By using Agent API, customers can make the most of our features, whilst creating their own custom UI.
