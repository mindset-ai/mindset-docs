# Mindset Embedding

## Get Started with Embedding&#x20;

Mindset provides Embed SDK to embed individual workflows or the whole Mindset experience in your web application or portal. Based on your embedding requirements and integration setup, you can use one of the following methods:

* [Mindset Embed SDK](embedding-sdk.md) (recommended but requires some understanding of JavaScript)
* [Embed using an iFrame](iframe-embedding.md) (simple to do but limited in capability)

If you are unsure which is the best approach to take, please contact support, and we will discuss your requirements and recommend an approach.&#x20;
