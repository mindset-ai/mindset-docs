# SharePoint

Our SharePoint integration allows you to effortlessly ingest video content from your SharePoint account into your knowledge banks, reducing the time and effort required to manually upload and sync content.

### How this integration works

Our SharePoint integration requires secure access to your selected Sites and folders. This integration ensures your chosen knowledge bank stays current with any new, updated, or deleted content from SharePoint. The frequency of the synchronization can be adjusted to suit your needs.
