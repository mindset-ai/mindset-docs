# WordPress

Our WordPress integration allows you to seamlessly ingest content from your WordPress site into your knowledge banks, reducing the time and effort required to manually upload and sync content.

### How this integration works

With our WordPress ingestion integration, we import posts and custom post types into a dedicated knowledge bank. This knowledge bank will stay up-to-date with any new, updated, or deleted posts from WordPress. The frequency of synchronization can be adjusted to fit your needs.\
