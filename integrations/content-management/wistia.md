# Wistia

Our Wistia integration allows you to effortlessly ingest video content from your Wistia account into your knowledge banks, reducing the time and effort required to manually upload and sync content.

### How this integration works

We can ingest Wistia content. One folder will sync to one knowledge bank, our knowledge banks will sync with your Wistia content as often as is useful.
