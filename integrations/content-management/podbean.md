# Podbean

Our Podbean integration allows you to effortlessly ingest podcast content from your Podbean account into your knowledge banks, reducing the time and effort required to manually upload and sync podcast content.

### How this integration works

With our Podbean ingestion integration, we'll seamlessly import your Podbean catalogue into a dedicated knowledge bank. This knowledge bank will stay up-to-date with any new, updated, or deleted podcasts. The synchronisation frequency between Podbean and your knowledge bank can be adjusted to fit your specific needs, ensuring your content is always current and accurately managed.
