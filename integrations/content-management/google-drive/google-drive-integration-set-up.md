# Google Drive Integration Set-Up

With this integration, we can sync data from your Google Drive into our knowledge banks. We will ingest all content from a folder in your Shared Drive into a knowledge bank and **automatically sync updates every week.** Any new files will be added, and any deleted files will be removed‚Äîensuring your knowledge bank always stays up to date.

#### **File formats supported** <a href="#file-formats-supported" id="file-formats-supported"></a>

üìÑ **Documents:** Google Docs, DOCX, PDF, txt\
üìä **Presentations:** Google Slides, PPTX\
üéµ **Audio:** MP3\
üé• **Video:** MP4

We do not support PDF files with no page-breaks.

#### **File size limit** <a href="#file-size-limit" id="file-size-limit"></a>

We don‚Äôt impose a strict file size limit, but very large PPTX files, and documents with extensive tabular data may not process correctly.

#### **Can we ingest from subfolders?** <a href="#can-we-ingest-from-subfolders" id="can-we-ingest-from-subfolders"></a>

‚úÖ **Yes!** We are able to ingest subfolders but it makes the deletion process more difficult depending on your setup, if you experience issues, reach out to us at [integrations@mindset.ai](mailto:integrations@mindset.ai).

#### **Permissions Required** <a href="#permissions-required" id="permissions-required"></a>

Our service account must have **Viewer** access to your Shared Drive.

‚ùå "**Contributor**" will NOT work, as only **Viewers** can download files, which is essential for this integration.

### **Step-by-step instructions** <a href="#step-by-step-instructions" id="step-by-step-instructions"></a>

1. **Create a Shared Drive**
   * This will store all the files you want to sync into your knowledge bank.
2. **Add Your Content**
   * Move or upload all the files into this Shared Drive.
3. **Grant Access to Mindset AI**
   * Add your Solutions Engineer and a Mindset service account as Viewers of the Shared Drive.
   * We will share the service account details with you once we begin the setup process.
   *   ![warning](https://mindset-ai.atlassian.net/gateway/api/emoji/0d3818bd-fbf4-4c0f-8445-86b8a821eae7/26a0/path) If you revoke this access, all the ingested content will be deleted from your knowledge bank, see below.

4. **Our Solutions Engineer Sets Up the Integration**
   * Once access is granted, our team will configure the integration for you.
5. **Syncing Begins**
   * Your knowledge bank will now automatically sync with the Shared Drive folder on a weekly basis.
6. **Adding More Folders Later?**
   * If you want to sync additional folders, just email `integrations@mindset.ai`, and we‚Äôll set up a new process for you.

#### How to stop the sync <a href="#how-to-stop-the-sync" id="how-to-stop-the-sync"></a>

You can stop the sync by reaching out to our integrations team at [integrations@mindset.ai](mailto:integrations@mindset.ai). If you revoke access to your GDrive folder from our Solutions Engineer or our service account, all of the content in your synced knowledge bank will be deleted.

#### **General Best Practices** <a href="#general-best-practices" id="general-best-practices"></a>

* **One folder per knowledge bank** ‚Äì Keep your structure simple for better organization.
* **Everything in the synced folder will be ingested -** there is currently no way to exclude specific files from a synced folder.
* **Avoid duplicates ‚Äì** The agent won‚Äôt recognize duplicates and may recommend the same file more than once.
