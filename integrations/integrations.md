# Embedding vs. Integration: Key Differences



### What is Embedding?

Embedding refers to the process of incorporating a specific component or an entire platform into your own website or application. This allows users to access and interact with the embedded content directly from your platform, eliminating the need to navigate to a separate site.\


### An Example: Mindset Embed SDK

Mindset Embed SDK allows you to embed specific components or the complete Mindset experience into your online application or site. This can be achieved using either the Mindset Embed SDK or an iFrame.



### The Mindset Embed SDK

The Mindset Embed SDK is a robust tool that enables you to embed the entire Mindset experience into your platform. However, it does require some understanding of JavaScript. This method is recommended for those who are comfortable with coding and wish to fully utilize the capabilities of the Mindset platform.

### &#x20;What is an Integration?

Integration entails linking two systems so that they can function together effortlessly. This can include sharing data between systems, activating actions in one system based on events in another, or merging features from both systems.



### Integrations on the Mindset platform

Mindset work with the Integration partner - Cyclr. They connect with over 500 applications such as Slack, Teams and Hubspot to bring together the mindset platform & these applications. Integrations in the Mindset context will involve the push or pull of data from or to systems. For example, Mindset may push information to Slack, with the goal of sending the user a message inside Slack. Each Integration will be set up individually to serve specific purposes.
