# Choosing Data for your Agent

### Quality over quantity <a href="#quality-over-quantity" id="quality-over-quantity"></a>

When choosing what to sync, focus on the most relevant and useful data—there’s no need to upload everything.

_Think of it like training your agent: a well-trained agent performs far better with focused, high-quality information rather than an overwhelming amount of general content._

### Avoid unnecessary clutter <a href="#avoid-unnecessary-clutter" id="avoid-unnecessary-clutter"></a>

The more targeted your content, the more accurate and helpful your agent’s responses will be. Irrelevant or outdated files just get in the way.

_Ask yourself: What do I actually want the agent to be able to do? Start with content that directly supports those goals._

### Avoid duplicates <a href="#avoid-duplicates" id="avoid-duplicates"></a>

The agent won’t recognize duplicate content—it may end up recommending the same file more than once. Keeping things clean reduces confusion and improves the overall experience.

### Keep it fresh <a href="#keep-it-fresh" id="keep-it-fresh"></a>

Agents are only as smart as the data they’re fed. If your documents change over time—like templates, FAQs, or onboarding guides—make sure the agent always has access to the latest version.

### Start small and refine <a href="#start-small-and-refine" id="start-small-and-refine"></a>

You don’t need to add everything at once. Upload a focused set of data, test how the agent performs, and adjust based on what’s working. Real questions and user feedback are your best guide for what to include next.
