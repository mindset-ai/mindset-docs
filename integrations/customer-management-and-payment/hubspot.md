# Hubspot

Our integration with HubSpot allows you to manage users on your platform at scale. If you use HubSpot to track customers, we can automatically create new users and accounts on your platform when you get a new customer.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** When you acquire a new customer (Customer A) with 50 users, the integration will create an account for Customer A and add all 50 users to that account.
{% endhint %}
