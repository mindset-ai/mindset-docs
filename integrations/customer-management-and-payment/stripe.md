# Stripe

Our integration between Stripe and your CRM provides a comprehensive view of customer transactions, ensuring accurate data flow across all your tools. This seamless integration enhances your customer experience from purchase through to usage.

### How this integration works

Due to the way the Mindset platform is set up, we donâ€™t directly connect with Stripe, but link your Stripe account to another CRM tool through an indirect integration, customised to your needs. If your CRM is integrated with Stripe, we can create a workflow between Stripe, your CRM, and Mindset.
