# Using Vimeo video

### This article helps users with a few guidelines and best practices for using Vimeo video content within their applications.

Content and engagements in the Mindset.ai platform can be configured to display Vimeo video content. This content is displayed using the Vimeo video player. The Vimeo video player can display a number of controls and options that can result in undesirable behaviour within your application. \


Here are a couple of guidelines or best practices to follow when using content from Vimeo:



For your video, select “Settings” on the right hand panel and then “Advanced settings” at the bottom.

**Embed controls**

* In the new screen, select Embed > Web > Actions.&#x20;
* We suggest you disable all 4 options (Like, watch later, share, Embed)\

Each of these options will direct a user to a Vimeo sign in page within your engagement or content.  It is not possible to return to the video without closing the piece of content and reopening it. So, it is recommended to disable these four actions.&#x20;

​​

**Interaction tools**

* Select Interaction tools> end screen
* Select Thumbnail, Empty, or Custom image

The other option will allow users to view other content that is not related to the engagement and can create a confusing experience for your users.
