# Contacting support

If you are facing an issue, or have a question you want to raise, you can create a Mindset Service Portal (MSP) ticket. The customer support team will review these tickets and respond as per our SLA, if there are comments or a change of status you will be updated via email notifications. For any other queries or questions, email your dedicated customer success executive and they will support you.

### How to raise a support ticket

Go to the [Mindset Service Portal (MSP)](https://mindset-ai.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1) and you will have two options, **General** and **Data and Reporting Requests.** Selecting General will give you the following options:

* Submit an Idea - if you have a proposal for a new feature or feature improvement.
* Technical support - if you are looking for technical guidance on a feature.
* Other questions - if you have queries about the platform or anything not covered above.
* Submit a bug - if you spot something that doesnt look right, or a feature not working the way you expect.

Selecting Data and Reporting Requests will give you the following options:

* Custom report request - if you are requesting a new liveboard or report.
* Data request - any request related to your application's data.

For any ticket type, you must fill in the mandatory fields and provide as much information as possible about your request. Click **Send** and your ticket has been successfully raised.
