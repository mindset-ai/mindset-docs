# How to configure Journeys

**Design your User's Journey Carousel**\
\
Select the **Journeys** tab on the left hand navigation under **Configure**.  You can configure the **unstarted Journeys carousel** and the **in progress Journeys carousel** adding the heading, background colour and text colour.\

Once configured, click Save on the top right-hand corner.&#x20;



**Creating new Journeys**

You can then create Journeys under App Information > Journeys on the left navigation bar. Click the Add new Journey button and you will be taken to an in-depth screen to add the Name, Image and estimated time as well as descriptive details. Once those details have been added, click Save in the top right-hand corner.\

Next, select the Assign Tags section on the left-hand side. Here you should add all the relevant tags associated with this Journey. This means that end-users with those tags will be assigned this journey. Need to create Tags? Read [this article ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WKf-vGqVVcvBVHIVwDhq3x9ckih5IeDyjBFIWefe\_WA/edit)first and return to this once you have created your Tags.

You can then, if you choose, configure your journey to include onboarding. If you would like to find out more information about your end-user, select Onboarding. You can amend this text to align with your application, for example, if you wanted to call it ‘Introduction’. Once saved, select Add step-item underneath Onboarding and select Survey question, here you can configure any initial questions you would like to ask your end-user.

Following Onboarding (optional step), add in your Steps. These are like chapters of your Journey which will segment any step items into chunks. You can configure these with a name and description as well as add in the estimated time it will take a user to complete.

Once the Steps are configured you can add in the Step items underneath. See the example below which uses the Survey question type, add in your survey details and answer options as well as the associated tags. You can continue doing this until your full Journey has been built out.

| Best practice tip: Having more steps in your journey is a great way to build natural themes and pauses into your end-users learning.  |

For the below example the Journey is finished with a Journey Success item, letting the user know they have completed the Journey. Once configured click Save and go back to the home screen.\

On the Journeys home screen, you will see your Journey card, select the ellipsis in the top right-hand corner of the card and click Publish when you are ready for your users to view the Journey.\

Once Published users can view it on their application. To edit a Journey select unpublish and this will remove it from a users application allowing you to edit it and re-publish. However, unpublishing a Journey will wipe the progress of users who have started it, therefore try to be as certain as possible with a Journey before publishing to limit edits.



**How end-users view Journeys**

Once published Journeys will appear on users with matching tags screens, like the below card. Here they can view the information you added such as estimated time as well as the image

After clicking on the card, users will see the option to ‘Get Started’ as well as what they will learn on the Journey.

Following this they will see the breakdown of the Journey into Steps and Step items. Users will need to complete these Steps sequentially to be able to complete the Journey.

Once all the steps are complete, the Journey card will appear on the user's home screen as ‘Completed’. As they are invited to other Journeys this card will move to the end of the carousel.
