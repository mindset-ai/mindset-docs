# Journeys

#### What is the Journeys workflow?

Journeys are a structured way of navigating content to help people reach learning or realisation. Each journey consists of a series of steps, and a step can consist of one or more step items, including videos, surveys, and downloadable material.&#x20;

\
A journey is made up of the following:



**Journey Overview** &#x20;

This lets users know more information about the journey. What it is about, how long it should take and what they will learn.

&#x20;

**Entry onboarding survey**

Onboarding questions are an opportunity to learn more about the user before they start a journey.&#x20;



**Journey path/steps**

Indicate the steps the user will take on this journey. Steps are a container for the content a user will consume when taking a journey.

\
**Step Items**

A single content item or a sequence of content items that make up a step within a journey. Step items can be a video, web article, survey, text question, or file download.&#x20;



**Exit survey (optional)**

This gauges how well the user has understood the journey content with an exit survey. Exit surveys are another opportunity to learn more about the user.



**Completion screen**

Reward the user for completing the journey and provide advice or hints on what they could do next.
