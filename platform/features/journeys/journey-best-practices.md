# Journey best practices

Journeys provide a structured approach to navigate through content, help individuals achieve bitesize learning or reach a point of realisation. Each journey comprises of multiple steps, where a step may contain one or more step items such as videos, surveys, and downloadable materials.&#x20;

\
Here are some of the best practices for utilising the Journeys workflow in your application



**Define Clear Goals** - Before you create a journey, clearly determine the purpose of each journey and the specific outcomes you want to achieve with it. Make sure that these goals align with the overall objectives of the app.



**Identify the User Personas** - Identify the different types of users who will be engaging with the journey and tailor the content and messaging accordingly. This will help you to achieve your goals more effectively.



**Keep It Simple** - Donâ€™t make the journey too long or add too many steps to it. Design journeys that are easy to follow and understand, and avoid overwhelming users with too much information. Think bitesize, digestible learning through various formats. This will help users to achieve their goals without getting distracted or confused.

\
**Personalise the Experience** - Remember that a journey is served to every user who has a matching tag associated. This is your opportunity to personalise the experience and make the most out of it. Use dynamic content to provide a personalised experience that changes based on user behaviour, preferences, or other factors. This will help you to provide a unique experience that adapts to each user's needs in real-time.
