# Mindset meter: sliding scale question

### What is a sliding scale question?

A sliding scale question allows a end-user to set a value from 1 - 100 in response to a question or statement by dragging a slider. \


This question type should be used to understand if a user has a positive or negative reaction to a question or statement.

### Interval screens

There are 5 interval screens within the Sliding Scale question. Each interval screen is displayed when the slider progresses between 0 - 100. This means that you’re able to design your screen to seamlessly adapt as the user adjusts the slider.&#x20;

### Designing your interval screens&#x20;

The image below highlights the layout of the interval screen and what content, colours and imagery can be included to bring your design to life.\

### Images used in the sliding scale

There are 2 images included in the sliding scale question screen - The Icon image and the Background image. Both can be provided in either .SVG, .png or .jpg format.

\
Image Icon:

This image will display best within your application when set with the aspect ratio of 1:1 (square).



Background image:

This image will display best within your application when set with the aspect ratio of approximately 4:1.&#x20;



You can be as creative as you wish with the background image - we would however recommend that If you’re using this image to create a shape within the screen, ensure that the top of the image retains the same colour as the background colour you’ve configured for the main part of the screen and the bottom remains white (or 0% opacity).  Much like the image displayed below.

### Using SVG’s

When using svg’s, it’s important to note the following best practices



* Keep lines and shapes as simple as possible.
* SVG’s must be flat 2 dimensional images - no shadows or gradients. If you upload an SVG with a gradient, it will not display correctly.&#x20;
* If it includes a shadow or an alpha layer, it will not display at all.&#x20;
* You can’t simply save a jpeg, or png file as an SVG - this won’t work.&#x20;
* When uploading any images, pay close attention to the preview available. This will indicate how the image will render in your app.&#x20;
