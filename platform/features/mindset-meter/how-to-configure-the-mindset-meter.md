# How to configure the Mindset Meter

The Mindset Meter is a workflow that allows you to understand your team in a better way by utilising pre-set surveys.  These pre-set surveys have multiple aspects to it that allow you to ask different kinds of questions to your end-users and understand them and their needs better.&#x20;

#### Configuring the Mindset Meter workflow

The process of  configuring the Mindset Meter for your app can be overwhelming. Follow the below step-by-step guide to get you started with the configuration and reach out to the Mindset AI Customer Success team if you need any support. &#x20;

There are seven tabs within the Mindset Meter that help you create an engaging experience for your team.&#x20;

1. **Home page Cards**
2. **Intro Step**
3. **Survey Questions**
4. **Results Handlung**
5. **Journaling and**
6. **History**
7. **Weekly Insights**

#### 1. Home page cards

The Home page cards tab contains three cards that aim to engage users and provide them an interactive and engaging experience that motivates them to check-in more frequently. &#x20;

These cards can be designed and personalised with different text, background, colours for buttons etc. Each card allows you to add a heading, body, image, and a call-to-action button.&#x20;



1. **Initial home page card –** This card allows you to create an engaging experience to launch the check-in session.

2. **Check-in complete card –** With this card, you can configure what to display after the user checks in. This card also allows users to review their history through Stored Check-ins. &#x20;

2. **Check-in reminder card –** This card provides the option to remind users to check in. You can choose to toggle this on or off, set a unique card, or simply copy the first one.&#x20;

#### 2. Intro step

The intro step is displayed only to the first time Mindset Meter users. You can use this space to explain the journey you’re about to take them on, its value, and the purpose of checking in. This provides an opportunity to sell this feature.&#x20;



<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 12.44.18.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can include a video from YouTube, Vimeo or any other link to make the Mindset Meter more exciting and include the text you’d want them to read and rename the continue button if you want to.&#x20;

#### 3. Survey questions

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 12.46.26.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can enhance the check-in experience by adding Survey Questions through this tab. There are three pre-set types of questions:&#x20;

* Multiple choice
* Sliding scale – employs imagery, score, and text.&#x20;
* Filter wheel – the axes communicate the user’s current state in a fun way.

Based on what you aim to achieve through improved check-in rates, these questions can be amended and layered to fit your Mindset Meter goals. &#x20;

It is mandatory to include either the filter wheel question or the sliding scale question for the mindset meter workflow to operate.&#x20;

#### 4. Results Handling

After constructing your survey questions, you can use the Results Handling area to configure which questions populate each part of the user’s check-in session. For instance, the twelve options (icons) incorporated in the filter wheel can be configured to include further branching questions to offer a unique experience, therefore achieving your Mindset Meter’s goal.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 12.52.30.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This area also allows you to:&#x20;

* Identify the most important ranking in each key survey question because the end goal is to help users reach the best state – which corresponds to the most important ranking.
* Assign a question for each of the Results Configuration cards:&#x20;
* Check-in display details – a summary card available in the final stage of the check-in, in the history, and in the check-in complete home page.
* Check-in state – the general state or most dominant feeling the user is recording.&#x20;
* Trigger reasons – why did the user check in as such? What is the main reason why they feel the way they do?&#x20;

The results are stored so that the user can track their progress and review previously reported check-ins from their profile screen.

#### 5. Journaling

**Personal journaling**

Under personal journaling, users can reflect on their check-in and take private notes to view later. These notes can only be viewed by the end-user.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 12.54.59.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can personalise the heading, guide text, hint text, and action button for the unique purpose of your app. Use this area to also reassure users that these notes will never be shared with their employers or the app admins by leaving a short data safety message.

**Account journaling**

This option allows users to leave anonymous feedback for their employer (through the app or account reporting). &#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 12.56.08.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



You can choose to either enable or disable this part.&#x20;

#### 6. History

As mentioned above, users will be able to access their check-in history from their profile page. You therefore need to configure this page and make it appealing using content that guarantees users remain engaged.&#x20;

The check-in history card heading and body text can be configured, along with adding in a check-in history card image. \


<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 12.57.09.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next, the check-in history page configuration can be created. This is the section where users can review their past check-in details. &#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 12.57.17.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Finally, the 'empty state for no check-ins on the current day' text can be configured. This is relevant if end-users have not checked in yet on the current day, this is what they will see displayed in their history. Here, the empty state title and body text can be added.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 12.57.21 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The history page is important for tracking progress and achieving your app’s goals.

#### 7. Weekly Insights

Here you can turn on the weekly insights report, which will be served to users once a week with a summary of their check-ins.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/BjMco9QfEoLKCamlNDHsALKvI9HPEOIqlwwc-EpIgpgkfHxPce2pji9MZHeJnd6XR0No3bLxXpMYsRVIFiVwcqBDNPsdmmdh6sfaTb1NLHoRs8arvUo3qPYHjs_8HgZOEXZL4SCIQHasGSTotvJtzYQ" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can configure the minimum amount of check-ins used to pull their weekly summary, we recommend at least 3 to get a good, valuable report. You can also choose the day in which the user is served their report as well as the delivery time. On the right hand side you can see a preview of what this could look like to the user in the application.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/nVG4WFw435LqaLxWRtZH8D3SgRINA8-6fupXygFLkjNmLIfM-xQH25EbVjrKkN24QXmbj_fXRIvINpQxPgBObI_wYXbVHe_LpAXW6fMq8ZcpwP3qvhmDjQX46Wv8b6pl4Y_x2dArh56zUzE1rfs1Qs0" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can also configure the awaiting weekly report state and no weekly report available state as placeholders.

Next, add in a home screen card. This is the card that will be displayed to end-users on their application home screen once their weekly report is ready. The heading text, text colour, and text area background colour can all be configured here. An image in an SVG, JPG, or PNG format can also be added. Please note, images should be at 13:5 to display correctly, and should not exceed 0.3MB in size.

&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/a_uVFAah7vOGxMMDqLcTWN8a2TxG3IDBAUT0XYxj45NVDux0Bk8lYYSwd5Ow1KQq54Zpzrg5O9d0QL_q7Bjm79I-PVVN-caszgR_MEi5U-bMCjWx8Cp3yN3HcrIZ6UYWo-ucqZMCNcIGH_RFYIVaBEs" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



Once you have configured your weekly insights home screen card, the body text for the check-in history card state when weekly insights are ready can also be configured. This is the text that end-users will see once their weekly insights become available.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/pb7qtadTn7ZMKQCkKdb3VyCARZQJLzfYeqDcGArwTEgvOburK02EXi26gT-g-OduOuHPTqIg6SGM2kOAZdRGArlKSKkpSP6aj_Agefy58DyzlG9zzyHXCxyHRy0_-zw6LIUCxY3nyF1rEYhDDoPtvy0" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next, the Frequency Data Tiles can be created. These display detailed insights to end-users about their previous check-ins. This includes their total number of check-ins from the specified week, their average number of check-ins per day, and their average recorded score from that week.&#x20;

These frequency data tiles can be toggled on or off depending on which insights you would like your end-users to see.

For each check-in insight, the title, as well as any additional information, can be configured.

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-xwdsWtYM0IlRMU6KNx7Ohcy1jb-XwkBZnUQjTCwZ7vOZf7-NEB8hZZ5RC4pJXXXjO72_G81ivyAioh_PMV1CN6EdvewCwhwOyutXi05k8s76pSATJarjv_3KP8HcNiG5wqEg2kJXfgFku_05sfcEgQ" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

An ascending/ descending indicator can also be added, which shows end-users their check-in activity from the current week comparatively to the previous week.&#x20;

The tile background and text colour can also be amended here.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/tRItPUY3Lw9fi7Ql7a4pi0WN06PzddLpkU7G_DiqyoUN751UKueA1Y11yFGxINfv0OKhVdGqVhCnke7DIAb6GVuUSNFkrC2t6GUGdKbBL9uyuRnw_krUixm5OHBuUq5StSqSGBJKMQg1vUirOr59Ft0" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Check-in Highlights can then be configured.

&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/R58BKoOVpG452Y9RvOBvgAyVH58ZqlKQPlpW0iQJJMO1FLm7qk7QqYagCdUgfvxwpLVBhdiTwToMLpdhLt5ADb_wZnBD2AQ3wCU_dgKiuC1SkbRzciVgMtJaG02YlkC5OHjUT0iBxLFLpBaPrLwDAOE" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here, the highest and lowest daily and weekly check-in information can be previewed by end-users. You can choose whether this score is based on the user's sliding scale answers, or alternatively their ranking check-in state. Please note that in order to display the highest and lowest ranking check-in state, you will need to assign ranking to the answer options of a filter wheel question in the survey questions section.

&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/RZoK5wzTXy4VO-2Y9gS_geG_AAgeJMRS0l5akTtBks8f-BX_yruQEuK6P88F5skp_vUR2a4BSpdOK9Ug_zLu2kQw5EZBvOytMAXRFEJBZSb2WgL8-hab9OUfQVQWiPYNAchXLmzs5bubblCpqaxpKz8" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next, you can configure your Check-in Summaries. This will display to end-users their most frequent daily and weekly check-in state. In addition to their most frequent check-in, you can also choose whether to present the most frequently selected trigger reasons for end-users to reflect on. The titles for the check-in summaries can also be configured here.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/yXoVXq6wsI5W4Y2_B4QLskLQYp9MpiOt2LVjDSpXACBO7LrOiyYgyRH197okekhC1Elz6T7O-nhRJIA8LP8i2uFfW6OJJtXszbDFQE6SivHnSfJh4cryZRb2PvHeheoSypTt6vFR15bIUC50LUQo3fc" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Average Score Chart can be used to show end users their daily and weekly average mood score chart. Please note that in order to have this average score chart previewed, the sliding scale Mindset Meter question type must be configured.

Finally, the Insights Order Preview can be viewed. This displays the order in which the insights will appear to end-users on both their ‘daily’ and ‘weekly’ tabs. The current order is Frequency data tiles, followed by Check-in highlights, Check-in summaries, and lastly Average score chart.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/u0bvJbDvtgZ9SOCPH7NgHY7cuJaFKvGlmRjZcDc_imw7QpNANT9i1Eg41gOQ0hNTPECXN0eO1CR1n20_yVsdulzT9ceMZLlN2-WatJazSKvNegESTu09BtHEp73otwOnaIFWKK3bNv0SqBERvug8y4k" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
