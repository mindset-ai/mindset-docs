# How to configure the Welcome workflow

The Welcome workflow is a default workflow which means it's already enabled in the admin portal as shown in the image below. It is the first screen users will see and includes a Carousel, Heading, and description text, a “Get Started” button for new users and a “Login” option for returning users.

Select the Pages tab inside the Welcome workflow, here you will see the option to Add a Welcome page. These pages create the carousel an end-user would see when they first visit the application. You can add up to 4 pages here each including an image, heading and message.

Below is an example of the carousel on the welcome page from the end-user perspective when they first use the application.
