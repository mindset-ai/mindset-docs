# General Tags

As an app administrator, you’ll set up general tags in the application administration portal and then assign the relevant tags to onboarding questions, content items, journeys, and engagements.

To create and configure General Tags, navigate to the “Tags” page of the “App information” section, then click on the “General tags” tab. There you will see a list of already existing General Tags. Click on the “Add a General tag” button to create a new tag.

In the configuration interface, you will be able to add a **name** and an **optional icon** for General Tag. Use a unique and meaningful name to ensure easier management of content. Or you can click on the mini menu **“●●●” icon,** against an existing tag, then click **“Edit”** to edit its configuration and change its name or icon.
