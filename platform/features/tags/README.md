# Tags

{% hint style="info" %}
This is only applicable to Onboarding, Journeys, Content Feeds and the Mindset Meter.

Tags are how the Mindset AI platform understands and learns about the groups of people using a product and allows it to adapt the user’s experience to better drive engagement and retention. ​Setting up the application’s tags is one of the first things you need to do as an application owner.

**Restrictive Tags**

Restrictive Tags are a way of delivering content to an individual or a group of people. The aim of this feature is to enable administrators to have stricter control over content distribution and further enable building a totally unique experience for end-users. Content that is tagged with one or more restrictive tags will be delivered only to users who possess the same restrictive tag or set of restrictive tags.

To ensure smooth delivery, we recommend assigning Restrictive Tags sparingly on content, as the more you add to an item the lower the number of people it will be delivered to. Aim at using up to 3 Restrictive Tags per piece of content. Vice versa, the more Restrictive Tags a user possesses the more content with Restrictive Tags they will receive.

**How do they differ from the current Tags (General Tags) in the application?**&#x20;

The difference between General Tags and Restrictive Tags lies within how the platform engine matches users with content. A piece of content that has only General Tags will be delivered to a user if they have any General Tag in common. On the other hand, content that has General Tags and a Restrictive Tag will be delivered only to users who possess the same Restrictive Tag.
