# Roles

**What is the Roles Workflow?**

The Roles workflow on the Mindset platform is an additional feature that allows administrators to define and manage a different role within the application. It provides a structured way to assign specific capabilities and permissions to different users based on their role.  By effectively utilising this feature, organisations can optimise their user experience, ensure data privacy, and promote workflows within the platform.



Currently Mindset provides only the **Coach role.** The Individuals who are assigned coach roles can track the Goals of their assigned coachees. The Coach role can be assigned to any app user at the app level, and any account user at the account level.\


**Coach Portal**&#x20;

Once you have configured the roles workflow on Mindset, added coaches and assigned coachees to them, the coaches receive an email with the URL to access their **Coach Portal.**&#x20;

The account coach interface is a space with a list of accounts that the user is a member of. This portal allows you to access the goals tracking areas with the list of coachees.&#x20;



The app coach portal is quite similar to the account coach portal, except that app coaches can see all their coachees on the dashboard regardless of the account they belong to.&#x20;



The coaches can monitor the information about the **Goals, Description, Actions** and **Metrics** for each of their coachee here.&#x20;



**How Does the Roles Workflow Add Value?**

**Role-based Access Control** -  The Roles workflow enables administrators to assign roles to users, which determines their access rights and permissions within the application. By assigning appropriate roles to users, you can ensure that they have access to the functionalities and data that are relevant to their responsibilities, while also protecting sensitive information from unauthorised access.\


**Customisation and Flexibility** - With the Roles workflow, administrators have the ability to configure and customise roles according to the specific needs of their organisation. They can define role permissions, tailor the role names, and enable roles at different levels such as the app level or account level. This flexibility allows for control over user access and aligns the application with the unique requirements of the business.



**Efficient User Management -** The Roles workflow simplifies user management by providing a centralised interface to view and assign roles to users. Administrators can easily track the number of users assigned to each role and manage their permissions from a single location. This streamlines the process of onboarding new users, adjusting roles as responsibilities change, and revoking access when necessary.



**Enhanced Collaboration** - By assigning roles within Mindset, the Roles workflow facilitates collaboration among different users and teams. Roles can be designed to align with specific responsibilities and workflows, enabling users to work together more effectively.&#x20;



For example, the Coach role allows designated individuals to track the goals of their assigned coachees, fostering a structured coaching relationship.

\
**Security and Compliance** - Role-based access control provided by the Roles workflow enhances security and compliance within the Mindset platform. It ensures that users only have access to the features and data necessary for their roles, reducing the risk of unauthorised actions or data breaches. This feature helps organisations adhere to privacy regulations and maintain data integrity.
