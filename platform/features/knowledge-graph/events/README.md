#### Knowledge Graph Workflow FAQs

### Read about commonly asked questions in relation to the Knowledge Workflow

**Is my IP protected?**

Yes. Your IP is our utmost priority and is protected in our vault. This vault locks in your IP via any content you upload and does not share it outside of your application. Your IP is not available to OpenAI to train their models (like ChatGPT).&#x20;

**Does it support other languages?**

The Learning Assistant currently only ingests English media, but using the **Strong Guidance Prompt** configuration field you can train your **Knowledge Assistant** to converse in any global language. Even if you speak to it in English, the Knowledge Assistant will always reply in the language you have configured it to use.

**Is the conversation tracked in data & reporting?**

Whilst in the beta phase, to best understand how users are engaging with this new functionality and how we can make it even better, Mindset is not encrypting questions to or answers provided by the Learning Assistant in our database and select members of our staff have access to these questions and provided answers. This will likely change once this functionality is generally available (but we’d love to get your feedback on this aspect - does your use case require for you to have access to users’ questions and answers?).&#x20;

Similarly, whilst this functionality is still in beta release, there is not yet any reporting available to you on your users’ level of engagement with the Knowledge Assistant.

**How much of the information comes from ChatGPT vs content in the bank?**

This is a topic that we are actively researching. The current **knowledge assistant** fares pretty well in basing its answers on the supplied information, especially if the users’ questions cover topics that are well represented in the supplied IP. The assistant sometimes gets confused if you have reappropriated a more common word in your specific domain to mean something else - a prime example of this is our company name! To the rest of the world “mindset” means something along the lines of “an established set of attitudes held by someone”. In our internal context testing we have found that the beta learning assistant sometimes veers towards the common meaning of “mindset” when asked about IP related to our company specifically.

**Can I have multiple banks?**

Yes you can have as many banks as you like. We would recommend keeping it to a minimum so it is easier to manage as an administrator.

**How many pieces of content can I put in a bank?**

You can add as many pieces of content as you’d like into one bank. However we would recommend not uploading more than 10 at a time.&#x20;

When uploading a PDF: The document should ideally not exceed 400 pages, but the size of the document does not matter as much as the structure of the information in it: the assistant cannot currently import scanned documents, schematics or tables present in the document. It deals far better with prose-based text.\
When uploading an MP3/MP4: the assistant will ingest the English words spoken in the media file and this transcription is optimal if the recording is high quality, with minimal background noise and only one speaker talking at any point. &#x20;

**Why are there multiple banks?**

Banks allow you to separate content out, perhaps into groups of users who should be given access. Future developments may include permissioning of banks. Currently, every end-user in your app can access content in all banks.

**What technology does this workflow use?** &#x20;

The learning assistant uses the latest commercially available Large Language Models (LLMs), augmented with your IP.



### Knowledge Graph Workflow FAQs

**How did the Knowledge Graph Workflow get its name?**&#x20;

Knowledge graphs (KGs) organise data from multiple sources, capture information about entities of interest in a given domain or task (like people, places or events), and forge connections between them.

We track people, events and ideas, and by using AI we are on a journey to attaching skills/ capabilities/ knowledge to every person in a companies ecosystem based on their content.

This journey will enable us to attach all skills and capabilities gained by users, and all skills/ capabilities that exist in experts heads, so it is searchable and can be visualised.

We want to be able to understand context of questions, personal language/ slang preferences and even acronyms used by customers that only make sense to them so the AI truly understands what people need, when they need it.
