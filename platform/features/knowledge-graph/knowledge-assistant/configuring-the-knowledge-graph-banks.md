# How to configure the Knowledge Graph Banks

The Knowledge Graph Banks are the section in which your content is stored and filed. The end-user would never know they were accessing particular banks of content but for the admin, it is a way of separating content. In the future, this may be how content is permissioned to specific users, so we would recommend thinking of the banks as perhaps free vs paid for content. There is no limit on the amount of content you can upload to one bank, initially, we recommend keeping fewer banks, each with lots of rich content. The content here is what the Knowledge Assistant will use to ‘learn’ from in order to deliver accurate and informative answers for your end users.

**How to Configure the Knowledge Graph Banks**

Under the Manage tab of the left-hand navigation bar, go to the Knowledge Graph section, here you will be able to configure the Banks for the Learning Assistant.

Can’t find the **Knowledge Graph** section under **Manage**? You may need to check the workflow has been turned on. Go to **Configure > Settings > Workflows** and check the **Knowledge Graph** toggle is on.

Select Add New Bank and give the Bank a name and short description - this is only used for the administrator and is not end-user facing.

Once saved, a Content tab will appear enabling you to add your Content into the Bank. Here you can input your content items. Content items can be uploaded in the following formats: PDF, MP3 or MP4, or MOV. You can upload or drag & drop your files into the bank, but you cannot upload more than 10 at a time.&#x20;

When uploading you will see the file processing on the right-hand side.

Once your **Bank** files have been processed they will sit in an unpublished state on the left hand side, now you have the opportunity to manually review the file before publishing.&#x20;

Click on the three dots in the right-hand corner and select **Edit**. Here you can amend the content display name, this is what the end-user will see when searching for content or looking at segments. You can amend the **Description** for that piece of content and add a thumbnail image. We recommend including thumbnails that represent your brand, as well as that piece of content, think about the topic, the speakers or the event and how you can represent this in the thumbnail. You also have the option to include the display date, this is how content will be ordered in the front-end for users i.e. most recent content.

&#x20;

The **Metadata** area is pre-populated but is editable, this is the information the language model will use to understand the file context. This is not viewable by end-users.

The **Transcription** tab shows the text directly extracted from the content you have uploaded.

**Configuring Segments**

On the **Segments** tab, you will see the content broken down into chapters, or segments, these are chunks of content that each relate to one topic. When a new segment is created, it means the topic has changed inside of the content.

For each **segment**, you can choose a **speaker,** or add one by selecting the Speaker -unknown boxes.

Select the box and type the person's name who spoke in that **segment**, when you have added that person once it will automatically populate them for any other segments where they speak. They will also be added as a speaker in the dropdown list.

&#x20;

This is important because the end-user can start engaging directly with specific speakers in the **knowledge assistant** chat i.e. ‘What does Niamh think about using Accounts?’ and they will get an accurate answer.

If you select the pencil button for each segment you can amend the transcript or update the **Segment** heading and summary. For example, if it has spelt someone's name wrong you can go and amend it.

&#x20;

If you want to double-check what that **segment** is referring to, in your content you can play the video segment directly.&#x20;

If you find the transcription consistently gets a word incorrect, you can use the search and replace feature to update this throughout the whole piece of content.

Once you are happy with the transcription, segments and speakers, click back to your list of content inside the bank. You can now start publishing these pieces of content to the **Knowledge Graph** workflow for end-users to instantly engage with.

**Publishing Content**

On each piece of content select the three dots in the right-hand corner and click **Publish File.**

&#x20;

Once **Published** you will see the green tick appear in the left-hand corner.

If you go back to the **Knowledge Graph** area, out of the **Bank**, you can see more tabs along the top.

The **People** tab will show you all of the speakers you have added, currently you cannot amend these here.

The **Discover** tab will show you how the Content Discovery feature will look to end-users, so you can test it on the admin side. _Please note Trending, Continue and Bookmarks have not been developed yet._

The **Assistant** tab will show you how the Knowledge Assistant feature will look to end-users, so you can test it on the admin side. Ask questions and engage with the segments to get a feel for the users’ experience.
