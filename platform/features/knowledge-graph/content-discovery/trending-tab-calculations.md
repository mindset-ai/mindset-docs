# How is the ‘trending’ tab calculated?

**What is the trending tab?**&#x20;

The Trending tab in the Content Discovery Feature enables end-users to see which content items are most popular as other user’s are engaging with them. The content items with the highest engagement and interaction will be visible at the top of the Trending list, whilst content with lower engagement levels will be visible further down the list.&#x20;

\
**Where can I find the trending tab?**&#x20;

The Trending tab can be found in the content discovery feature of your Knowledge Graph Workflow underneath the search bar. It is one of four tabs which can be found here, including What’s New, Continue, and Saved.&#x20;

**How is the trending tab calculated in my application?**&#x20;

The trending tab is based on the number of times a content item (video or PDF) is accessed from any interface.

\
This means that the greater the number of users in your application who have engaged with a content item, the higher up the ‘Trending’ list that content item will appear.&#x20;

\
Please note that the trending tab is based on the last 7-14 days of user activity.&#x20;

\
We no longer consider distinct users or have any limitation on what can be trending.&#x20;
