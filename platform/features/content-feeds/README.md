# Content Feeds

Content Feeds are a way of delivering relevant content to end-users (much like social media or news applications) in an unstructured fashion. \


Users are fed information according to a predefined schedule, linking to their Tags which are associated with them by their behaviours (such as when they are onboarded). Content can be grouped into one or many feeds which are displayed on the end-users app home screen. End-users can save content items to a library to access at any time. End-users can also reach out to an expert or app-admin directly from a content item.
