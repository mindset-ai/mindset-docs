**Adding Content to the Content Feed**

When adding your content, go to the Content section on the left-hand navigation bar under Account Information. Click on the Add a content item button and you will see a drop-down containing three options; Youtube video, Vimeo video and Web article. For Youtube and Vimeo, you can add in a URL, heading and description as well as assign it to a Content Feed and assign Tags on the right-hand side.

For the Web article, when adding it as a piece of content always check whether the URL can be used elsewhere, do this by pasting the URL you want to use in between the speech marks on the left-hand side of this page - [https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml\_iframe](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml\_iframe) and click Run. If you can see a preview on the right, this URL is compatible, if not, please choose a different URL as this wonâ€™t appear for end-users on the web application.



Once the URL is confirmed as compatible you can use the auto-fill button to fill in the details for you. You can also choose to upload your own image or use the auto-fill one. Similarly to other Content types, you must assign the Content Feed and Tags on the right-hand side. Once saved this is live in your Content Feed straight away.
