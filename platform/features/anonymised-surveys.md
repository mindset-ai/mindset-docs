# Anonymised Surveys

Anonymised surveys allow admins to create surveys that are completely anonymous with no personal identification data being collected from the end-user.

## How to configure an anonymised survey

Check you can see the **Anonymised Survey** workflow on your left-hand navigation, if not please contact your Customer Success Executive to turn this on for you. \
\
On the left hand navigation go to **Configure** and **Anonymised Survey** and configure the **Survey closed or not found** message.  Users will see this message when they access an invalid or expired survey link.  You can change the **Image**, **Title** and **Body text.**
