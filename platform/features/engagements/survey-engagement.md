### How to configure a survey engagement

To create your first engagement, navigate to the “Engagement library” page of the “App information” section. Click on the Engagements tab and the Add new engagement button, and select from the dropdown which item you want to create.

To configure a Survey engagement choose Survey from the Add new engagement item drop-down. Here you can add a heading, description, survey image, initial button text, and in-progress button text. You will see a preview of this engagement on the right-hand side of the screen.

Following this, you can start to construct the survey, adding the intro step, the questions, configure the results handling, processing the results, completed step and published locations. These are all important steps to keep the user engaged and to produce valuable data.

Clicking on the Intro step tab you are able to enable a survey introduction, this can help explain the process, and tell the user how to approach the questions or why the survey should be completed. If enabled, you can add the Survey title, include a video, introduction text, and the start survey button.

The Survey questions tab is where you can build out your survey to include either multiple choice questions, ranking questions, open-ended questions, scale questions, or a spacer page. You also have the option here to enable Close action to discard current survey progress. If disabled this means that if a user taps close, their progress will be retained and they can re-enter the survey process at the current point. If enabled, tapping the icon will discard all answers provided and the user will have to start the process afresh again.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/F-HARteT-25\_Z20W4UYjR4P7Dh8dJgVkV7fjJL8jvCt2V5NEI4lke8fEcDoytDHhs8PezVcsqtRoftS3lDw4rTpIYh03KzHFMaxAR8vUimNEHFQH7k38HKgZSLI7pdQ-v5hx5zUtTW-tkrRnxlhMs4A)



To add your question/s click the Add new question button. Note: when creating these questions, many require your answers to be related to a Tag. This is to enable the serving of content to users based on their answers. As an example, adding the multiple-choice question will direct you to the screen where you can configure the questions. Here you can amend the heading, supporting text, the number of answers, and button text, as well as enable the All answers must be used and Available answers depend on the response to the previous question toggles. \

Once the question has been configured, select the Direct answers tab and add the various answer options with their associate tag. Here you can also enable scoring of answers if a calculation will be performed once the survey is complete.
