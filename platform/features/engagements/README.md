# Engagements

### What are Engagements?&#x20;

Engagements are the basic building blocks used to communicate and interact with users through content. An engagement could be a single or a multi-step process. It enables app creators to deliver different types of content, and encourages users to perform actions or gather inputs.

A Facilitation can't run without engagements but engagements need to be created first and then pulled into a facilitation when it is set up.

Engagements can be created at two levels: App and Account. Account admins only have access to engagements that are created within their accounts. App admins have access at all levels. Users will only receive App level engagements and engagements in any account they are a member of.

### Engagement Types

Survey engagement

The survey engagement allows you to learn more about, and engage with, your user base by asking them a single or series of questions. Surveys can be in the context of a facilitated event or as a single engagement pushed to the users home screen. Results of a survey are displayed both to the user and to the app administrator in the tableau dashboard.&#x20;



**What can be included in a survey:**

Surveys can be configured to capture a simple answer or to calculate a complete series of questions - the opportunities are endless. There are multiple parts of a survey - you can use the following as you wish:

* Start & in-progress: Draw the users attention and keep them informed with a card that displays wherever you choose to deliver your engagement.&#x20;
* Intro pages: Start the survey process by providing more context about the survey itself.&#x20;
* Spacer pages: provide breaks in long surveys with spacer pages
* Process Results: If your survey is being used to calculate a result, let users know what is happening before the results are displayed.&#x20;
* Completed state: Can choose to display the results of a survey as a chart on a page and on the user profile screen - permanently or for a moment of time.&#x20;



**Question types**

Surveys can be configured as a single question or series of questions of varying types. The question types currently available are:

* Ranking questions: Allows users to reorder the priority of a list of answers in response to a question.
* Opened question: Allow for the gathering of quantitative data in response to a question.
* Likert scale: Measure the respondent’s emotional attitude toward a statement of agreement, frequency, quality, importance etc.&#x20;
* Multiple or single choices: Allow users to select one or many options from a list provided.



**Reflection engagement**

The reflection engagement allows app creators to send their users a series of open-ended questions and encourage them to write notes. Users' notes are not accessible to app creators.

Using this, users can journal, self-assess, or record their thoughts on specific topics related to the content within the app.



What can be included in a reflection:

* Spacer pages  - a spacer page is used to provide further context to the reflection. ​An image, text, a document attachment, and a link to additional materials could be added here. The reflection process can be divided into sections with spacer pages.
* Open-ended questions - the reflection engagement can include multiple open-ended questions.



**Voting engagement**

The Voting Engagement allows the use of a voting system within a facilitation. The goal is to enable a group of people to come up with a list of priorities or objectives collaboratively. This is accomplished through a guided process of gradually narrowing down a list of ideas or options. In an in-person workshop setting, a facilitator would typically do this with sticky notes and voting dots and be able to manage the process themselves from the number of votes each person gets and how many rounds of voting the group would go through. The voting engagement looks to replicate that in-person process.&#x20;



**360 Feedback Survey**

The 360 Feedback Survey engagement was designed to enable a Leader to be the driver of their own 360 review process, while the Admin plays mostly a support role. Once the engagement is set up and delivered to the Leader, they can invite as many reviewers as they want and monitor their progress.

The 360 Feedback workflow and 360 Feedback Survey engagement can be used to facilitate a review process for just 1 person or a cohort. The engagement is fully configurable and gives you the ability to create a personalised experience for both Leaders and Reviewers. It enables you to easily segment Reviewers into groups and present Leaders with a report based on collective scores per segment.



**Content engagement**

Content engagement allows app creators to create text, image and video content which enables diverse formats of engaging content that can be used to communicate and interact with end-users. The content engagement can be used inside facilitation, on the home screen, or sent to end-users via their account.



In a video content, the hero content is a video. Videos are particularly useful for communicating complex or unfamiliar topics, describing long, multi-step processes, or avoiding overwhelming users with too much text.



What can be included in a video message:

* Video - videos hosted on either Vimeo or YouTube could be added here.
* Supportive text - when you add supportive text to your videos, you can aid users who prefer to get a general idea about the content of the video before watching. The text should be easy to skim, meaningful, and not too long.
* Attachment and external link - these can be added if users have to go through anything additional to the main video content in their own time.



A text content is text-focused which an be used to communicate short bits of information that need to be noticed. Examples include reminders and announcements.

What can be included in a text content:

* Heading - this is a short piece of text meant to visually capture attention and provide direct context for the main text content.
* Text content - this is the most important part of the text message. You should keep this short, easy to read, and focused on the topic you wish to convey. Too much text will reduce user engagement.
* Attachment and external link - these can be added if users have to go through anything additional to the main text content in their own time.

An Image content is focused on using images to communicate information.



**Web engagement**

The Web engagement allows app creators to include external web URL links enabling diverse formats of engaging content that can be used to communicate and interact with end-users.



**Download engagement**

The Download engagement allows application administrators to upload documents in different file formats like PDF, Doc, Docx, CSV, etc., with the provision of attaching up to 5 documents that can be used to communicate and engage with end-users.\


**Assessment Engagement**

The assessment engagement is a way to understand the learning needs of end-users. It can be used in 2 primary ways:

1. To understand a user or organisation’s baseline level of knowledge, in order to present them with targeted content and learning (as well as identify consulting opportunities)
2. To test a user’s knowledge after completing a learning experience - such as a facilitataion or learning journey.
