# Assessment Engagement

### What is the Assessment Engagement?

The Assessment engagement can be used to understand the learning needs of end-users. It can be used in 2 primary ways:

1. To understand an end-user or organisation’s baseline level of knowledge, in order to present them with targeted content and learning (as well as identify consulting opportunities)
2. To test an end user's knowledge much like a quiz after completing a learning experience - such as a facilitation or learning journey.

### Configuring the Assessment Engagement



To create an Assessment Engagement, navigate to the “Engagement library” page of the “App information” section. Click on the Engagements tab and the Add new engagement button, and select Assessment Engagement from the dropdown menu.&#x20;

You will then see the Assessment display tab where you can configure the foundations of the Engagement. Create a title, description, and button text and add an image.

Much like [Survey Engagements](survey-engagement.md), you can choose to include an intro step with a video to explain more about the Assessment and why end-users should complete it.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/g\_dg9\_FiGPSifARWJoyw42YAySpaZ0MiiQCxoNOLUgiKParVQUhM7UuH85NRqOZMzJAEhVdRz-VVTXjluXWG1vWpoPGShanWr0pK0iYTS\_qcYgKJK4gh5ffssEQEAudxbahHhDf0i13Tq4Gq2y8a5wg)



Under the Settings tab, you can then decide whether your Engagement should show the correct answers after each question (like a quiz) or whether end users are just inputting their answers for the application administrator to review (like an assessment). Depending on what you are trying to achieve with this Engagement you can choose either option and hit save. ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/xosJAkkEE\_UBPlbgqRZ83DORZ23T4\_m-QNe8rI5qqnXIaBYYKKqmYk7hDxMWJ8EJcyZ9onDETDi4TdsUtOsKxUQ4bl4auLZqMxhFhcO6mVgbKjt7ZwcCdKiWIvWupwZfvbKVIqqWn4FOB3rM6F185Xg)



You can also decide whether to give the end user an action plan or not. When enabled, they will see an action plan at the end of the assessment/quiz. This will give them guidance on areas they may need to work on. You can specify which answers are added to the action plan and what the action is for each answer.\

If you toggle yes on the action plan end-users will be able to see the plan at the end of their assessment / quiz.  To configure this go to the Action plan tab and add the various actions you want end-users to be shown. You will be able to link them once the survey questions are configured.

To add the questions to the Assessment Engagement go to the Survey Questions tab, here you can add a multiple-choice question, an open-ended question or a spacer page. The configuration here is the same as [Survey Engagements](https://info.mindset.ai/help/how-to-create-and-configure-surveys). To demonstrate the multiple choice question, you can add a heading, supporting text, a category and button text. Once you have configured your question, add the Answers and configure the number correct, scoring options, tagging and immediate feedback.

If you have an action plan you can also assign this question to an action by going onto the map actions tab and choosing the action per incorrect question.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Fd-4ZKIobDrh1h-w0Y7i9onpV4sbm0Nb9RS08ZqZ5uVFvjMmw75kVIsLpsSpe6EnC7gyiM7DwcIy2XukI8fFYHV0OZxOlYNUYVn1TdKsknmeQeGnQNtGl5R8UroYN7qtBrBzucDMwNkTpzKboyAjOtU)

Configure the completion and results page under the Results tab. Here you can add an image, message and display their score.

You can then configure the completed state card and where you want it to display for the end-user.
