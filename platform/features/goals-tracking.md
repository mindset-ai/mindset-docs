# Goals Tracking

The Goals Tracking workflow provides end users with the ability to record their goals and the individual actions they will take to achieve the goals. End users are able to create their own goals and actions which can be tracked by the coach assigned to them.&#x20;

#### Setting up the Goals Tracking Workflow &#x20;

The Goals Tracking workflow should be visible in your left hand navigation bar. If you are unable to see the Goals Tracking workflow, please reach out to a member of the Mindset Customer Success team who will be able to switch the workflow on for you.&#x20;

Select the Goals Tracking workflow under the Configure heading.&#x20;

Under the General settings tab, you can amend the workflow nouns. This includes configuring the Goal singular noun and Goal plural noun fields as well as the Action singular noun and Action plural noun fields.

You can also enable metrics here by toggling the 'Enable Metrics' button. This means end-users can set metrics for their goals. The metrics singular noun and plural noun can be configured, too.&#x20;

Remember to click on the Save button at the top of the screen.

After configuring the workflow nouns, scroll down to the Workflow card section to configure the Initial text (a short message to encourage users to create goals and actions), and upload an Icon (an image to create a visual representation of the workflow) which will be displayed on the end userâ€™s profile screen and can optionally be displayed on the home screen as well.

Finally, you can set up the metric units, if enabled. You can add multiple units to your units list by selecting the 'add unit' button. Some examples have been configured below.

Next, click on the Goals screens tab to configure the goals screen (the screen where the end users can list their goals). Here, you will configure the Empty state title (a short message to encourage users to start creating goals), as well as the empty state body text - this can be used to describe to the user the benefits of utilising the workflow. \

When selecting 'add new' - the user will be invited to fill in details of the goal they are wishing to make. This includes adding a goal title, description, start date, and target date for goal completion.&#x20;

If metric tracking has been enabled, users will then be invited to add metrics associated with their chosen goal. Metrics can be useful for users, to enable them to measure their progress toward achieving their goal.

The user can add in their metric title, as well as their baseline level, target level and current level. Units can be selected here also.&#x20;

In addition to metric configuration, actions can be added which can enable the user to input the actions and steps necessary to reach their goal. For example, if the goal was 'to run 5k' an action may be 'attend a run club'.&#x20;

_**Please note:**_ Multiple actions can be added for one goal.&#x20;

A due date for an action can be added when inputting the action itself. This is beneficial in enabling users to manage their goal progress and remain accountable.

Once an action has been created, the user can click on the check box to mark the action as completed.&#x20;

Any completed actions or remaining actions can be seen by users when clicking into the specified goal. This enables them to efficiently and effectively track the progress of their goal and ensure they are on track for success.&#x20;
