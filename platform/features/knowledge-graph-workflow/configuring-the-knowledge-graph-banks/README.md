# Knowledge Banks

The Knowledge Banks are the section in which your content is stored and filed. The end-user would never know they were accessing particular banks of content but for the admin, it is a way of separating content. In the future, this may be how content is permissioned to specific users, so we would recommend thinking of the banks as perhaps free vs paid for content.&#x20;

There is no limit on the amount of content you can upload to one bank, initially, we recommend keeping fewer banks, each with lots of rich content. The content here is what the agents will use to ‘learn’ from in order to deliver accurate and informative answers for your end users.

**How to Configure the Knowledge Banks**

Under the **Manage** tab of the left-hand navigation bar, go to the **Knowledge** section, here you will be able to configure the **Banks** for your agents.

Select **Add New Bank** and give the Bank a **name** and short **description** - this is only used for the administrator and is not end-user facing.

Once saved, a **Content** tab will appear enabling you to add your Content into the Bank. Here you can input your content items. Content items can be uploaded in the following formats: PDF, MP3 or MP4, or MOV. You can upload or drag & drop your files into the bank, but you cannot upload more than 10 at a time.&#x20;

When uploading you will see the file processing on the right-hand side.

Once your **Bank** files have been processed they will sit in an unpublished state on the left hand side, now you have the opportunity to manually review the file before publishing.&#x20;

Click on the three dots in the right-hand corner and select **Edit**.  Under the **Content Item Settings** tab you can amend the content **Display Name**, this is what the end-user will see when searching for content or looking at segments. You can amend the **Description** for that piece of content and add a **thumbnail** image. We recommend including thumbnails that represent your brand, as well as that piece of content, think about the topic, the speakers or the event and how you can represent this in the thumbnail. You also have the option to include the **Display date**, this is how content will be ordered in the front-end for users i.e. most recent content.

You have the option to exclude the content from the Discovery and Segments panel. Enable this if the content should be available to the agent for the formulation of answers, but should not be directly available to users via the **Discovery and Segments panel**.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Summit10 2024-06-18 16-55-16.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next **Labels** can be added to organise the content for your end-users (in the Content Discovery interface). Labels need to have been set up already under the **Knowledge > Labels** tab.

**Metadata**

The content metadata is used by the language model to understand the file's context (this is not viewable to end-users).  The **Known As** and **Summary** fields are pre-populated however can be edited. **Known As** can be changed to explain the type of media file, e.g. Video or PDF for instance.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/summit10 2024-06-18 17-23-48.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



If the file is a PDF a **Transcription** tab will be seen next to the **Content Item Settings** tab showing the text directly extracted from the content you have uploaded.

**Configuring Segments**

If the file is an MP3, MP4 or Mov you will see a Segments tab next to the Content Items Settings tab. In the **Segments** tab, you will see the content broken down into chapters, or segments, these are chunks of content that each relate to one topic. When a new segment is created, it means the topic has changed inside of the content.\

For each **segment**, you can choose a **speaker,** or add one by selecting the **Speaker - unknown** boxes.

Select the box and type the person's name who spoke in that **segment**, when you have added that person once it will automatically populate them for any other segments where they speak. They will also be added as a speaker in the dropdown list.

This is important because the end-user can start engaging directly with specific speakers in the **agent** chat i.e. ‘What does Niamh think about using Accounts?’ and they will get an accurate answer.

If you select the pencil button for each segment you can amend the transcript or update the **Segment** heading and summary. For example, if it has spelt someone's name wrong you can go and amend it.

&#x20;

If you want to double-check what that **segment** is referring to, in your content you can play the video segment directly.&#x20;

If you find the transcription consistently gets a word incorrect, you can use the **search and replace** feature to update this throughout the whole piece of content.

Once you are happy with the transcription, segments and speakers, click back to your list of content inside the bank. You can now start publishing these pieces of content to the **Knowledge** workflow for end-users to instantly engage with.

**Publishing Content**

On each piece of content select the three dots in the right-hand corner and click **Publish File.**

&#x20;

Once **Published** you will see the green tick appear in the left-hand corner.

The Access Management tab allows you to choose which of your accounts have access to the selected Knowledge bank.&#x20;

The Knowledge bank can either be configured with open access - where all application members are able to view and search published content, including users who are members of any account; or restricted access, where only members of selected accounts are able to view and search published content in the knowledge bank.&#x20;

To set up restricted access banks, select the 'restricted access' button and click save.&#x20;

Next, you can select from your list of accounts below, the ones you wish to have access to the selected Knowledge bank. To do this, toggle on the button next to the account you wish to grant access to the bank, and click save.&#x20;
