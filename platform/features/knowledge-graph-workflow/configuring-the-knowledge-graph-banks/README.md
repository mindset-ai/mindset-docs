# Knowledge Banks

Knowledge Banks are a way of segmenting the content that helps to train Agents. These banks are not visible to end-users, only application administrators when deciding which banks the Agent can access.&#x20;

There is no limit on the amount of content you can upload to one bank, however we recommend keeping fewer banks, each with lots of rich content to keep it specific. The content here is what the agents will use to ‘learn’ from in order to deliver accurate and informative answers for your end users.

There are currently two types of knowledge banks - content banks and synced banks.&#x20;

The difference is in the way files can reach the bank. \
**Content bank -** files can be uploaded directly into the bank.\
**Synced bank -** files are ingested and synced from an external source such as Gdrive, via an ingestion integration.

Files cannot be deleted from a synced bank, however, edits can be made to the metadata of the files such as display name, description, and summary. Any changes made to the metadata will be honored during the syncing process. &#x20;

To learn more about integrations, please go to I[ntegrations](broken-reference).
