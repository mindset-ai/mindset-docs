# Knowledge Banks

The Knowledge Banks are the section in which your content is stored and filed. The end-user would never know they were accessing particular banks of content but for the admin, it is a way of separating content. In the future, this may be how content is granted to specific users, so we would recommend thinking of the banks as perhaps free vs paid-for content.&#x20;

There is no limit on the amount of content you can upload to one bank, initially, we recommend keeping fewer banks, each with lots of rich content. The content here is what the agents will use to ‘learn’ from in order to deliver accurate and informative answers for your end users.

There are currently two types of knowledge banks - content banks and synced banks.&#x20;

The difference is in the way files can reach the bank. \
**Content bank -** files can be uploaded directly into the bank.\
**Synced bank -** files are ingested and synced from an external source such as Gdrive, via an ingestion integration.

Files cannot be deleted from a synced bank, however, edits can be made to the metadata of the files such as display name, description, and summary. Any changes made to the metadata will be honored during the syncing process. &#x20;
