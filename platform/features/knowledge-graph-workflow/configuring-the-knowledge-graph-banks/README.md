# Knowledge Banks

The Knowledge Banks are the section in which your content is stored and filed. The end-user would never know they were accessing particular banks of content but for the admin, it is a way of separating content. In the future, this may be how content is permissioned to specific users, so we would recommend thinking of the banks as perhaps free vs paid-for content.&#x20;

There is no limit on the amount of content you can upload to one bank, initially, we recommend keeping fewer banks, each with lots of rich content. The content here is what the agents will use to ‘learn’ from in order to deliver accurate and informative answers for your end users.

**How to Configure the Knowledge Banks**

Under the **Manage** tab of the left-hand navigation bar, go to the **Knowledge** section, here you will be able to configure the **Banks** for your agents.  Select **Add New Bank:**

Then give the Bank a **name** and short **description** - this is only used for the administrator and is not end-user facing.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/summit10 2024-06-19 21-05-18.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once saved, a **Content** tab will appear enabling you to add your Content into the Bank. Here you can input your content items. Content items can be uploaded in the following formats: PDF, MP3 or MP4, or MOV. You can upload or drag & drop your files into the bank, but you cannot upload more than 10 at a time.&#x20;

When uploading you will see the file processing on the right-hand side.

Once your **Bank** files have been processed they will sit in an unpublished state on the left hand side, now you have the opportunity to manually review the file before publishing. Click on the three dots on the right-hand corner of the file and select **Edit**. &#x20;

Under the **Content Item Settings** tab, you can amend the content **Display Name**, this is what the end-user will see when searching for content or looking at segments. You can amend the **Description** for that piece of content and add a **thumbnail** image. We recommend including thumbnails that represent your brand, as well as that piece of content, think about the topic, the speakers or the event and how you can represent this in the thumbnail. You also have the option to include the **Display date**, this is how content will be ordered in the front-end for users i.e. most recent content.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Summit10 2024-06-19 08-31-21.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You have the option to exclude the content from the Discovery and Segments panel. Enable this if the content should be available to the agent for the formulation of answers, but should not be directly available to users via the **Discovery and Segments panel**.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Summit10 2024-06-18 16-55-16.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next **Labels** can be added to organize the content for your end-users (in the Content Discovery interface). Labels need to have been set up already under **Knowledge** on the left-hand navigation, and selecting the **labels** tab (reference this [article](../content-discovery/setting-up-content-discovery-carousels.md) for details on how to set up labels).

**Metadata**

The content metadata is used by the language model to understand the file's context (this is not viewable to end-users).  The **Known As** and **Summary** fields are pre-populated however can be edited. **Known As** can be changed to explain the type of media file, e.g. Video or PDF for instance.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/summit10 2024-06-18 17-23-48.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



If the file is a PDF a **Transcription** tab will be seen next to the **Content Item Settings** tab showing the text directly extracted from the content you have uploaded.

**Configuring Segments**

If the file is an MP3, MP4 or Mov you will see a **Segments** tab next to the Content Items Settings tab. In the **Segments** tab, you will see the content broken down into chapters, or segments, these are chunks of content that each relates to one topic. When a new segment is created, it means the topic has changed inside of the content.\


<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Summit10 2024-06-19 08-48-13.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For each **segment**, you can choose a **speaker,** or add one by selecting the **Speaker - unknown** boxes.

Select the box and type the person's name who spoke in that **segment**, when you have added that person once it will automatically populate them for any other segments where they speak. They will also be added as a speaker in the dropdown list.

This is important because the end-user can start engaging directly with specific speakers in the **agent** chat i.e. ‘What does Niamh think about using Accounts?’ and they will get an accurate answer.

If you select the pencil button for each segment you can amend the transcript or update the **Segment** heading and summary. For example, if it has spelled someone's name wrong you can go and amend it.

&#x20;If you want to double-check what that **segment** is referring to, in your content you can play the video segment directly.&#x20;

If you find the transcription consistently gets a word incorrect, you can use the **search and replace** feature to update this throughout the whole piece of content.

Once you are happy with the transcription, segments, and speakers, click back to your list of content inside the bank. You can now start publishing these pieces of content to the **Knowledge** workflow for end-users to instantly engage with

**Publishing Content**

On each piece of content select the three dots in the right-hand corner and click **Publish File.**

&#x20;

Once **Published** you will see the green tick appear in the left-hand corner.

**Access Management**

**Access Management** is managed through Agents. Users will have access to Knowledge banks through the agents they are entitled to use.  Users will also have access to this content through the Content Discovery interface if enabled.&#x20;

The type of bank configured is visible in your administration portal above the Knowledge bank name (e.g. Open access content bank).

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-03-07 at 16.45.06.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_**Please note:**_ The default Knowledge bank in your application will always be an 'open access content bank'.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-10 at 15.15.34.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The **People** tab will show you all of the speakers you have added in your segments.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Summit10 2024-06-19 21-26-16.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



Within the list of speakers, you can edit their profile by selecting the three dots by their name, followed by 'edit'.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Summit10 2024-06-19 21-32-56.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can add their Profile URL (LinkedIn, social, or other website URL for this person). When users are chatting with the agent **people** (speakers) will be related to the suggested content segments and will link to any associated Profile URLs.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Summit10 2024-06-19 21-30-47.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Discover**

The **Discover** tab will show you how the Content Discovery feature will look to end-users, so you can test it on the admin side.&#x20;

**Labels**

The **Labels** tab enables the configuration of labels, these can be added to help organise your content for your end-users. To find out more about setting up labels, please read our article on Setting up Content Discovery carousels [here.](../content-discovery/setting-up-content-discovery-carousels.md)



#### Content bank vs synced bank 

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD\_4nXcoRzzChQIq9cRfKptEVPp\_X0oGzx-Od2ZWOhLpHixQBMrwLOOo7GGCkHCZWcbrLwgbEbapdwUgAVs3tpQ6e3jjLPGCAM8Zs0nJTRuApDC17CJ9Wmdp2EIaIGB1EhRVxlazYEXzXsMJ2m41uXmfjiGcr9go?key=WMZddIwpzqNg7YwDudp2Ww)

\
There are currently two types of knowledge banks - content banks and synced banks.&#x20;

The difference is in the way files can reach the bank.&#x20;

\
**Content bank -** files can be uploaded directly into the bank.

\
**Synced bank -** files are ingested and synced from an external source such as Gdrive, via an ingestion integration.



Files cannot be deleted from a synced bank, however, edits can be made to the metadata of the files such as display name, description, and summary. Any changes made to the metadata will be honored during the syncing process. &#x20;

In order to find out more about integrations, please go to our [integrations article.](broken-reference)\
