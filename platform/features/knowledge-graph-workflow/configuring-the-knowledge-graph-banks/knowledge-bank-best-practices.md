# Knowledge Bank best practices

To configure and create the best Knowledge Banks for your Agents, follow these below best practices.

* Ensure your PDF content follows a clear structure, including the use of headings and sub-headings.&#x20;
* When uploading content, review the value of the content and establish the value end-users will get from it. If its not valuable, don't add it.
* Ensure the name of the file does not start with '#', or end with .mp4, .mp3, .mov, or .PDF.
* The length of the content does not matter as it will be segmented.
* Ensure the processing of videos includes titles for each segment and that these titles make sense. The system will produce AI-generated titles but sometimes they need tweaking.
* We recommend always adding a thumbnail image - this helps end-users understand the content topic and decide whether they want to engage. In order to find out more about setting up a successful thumbnail image, please see our [Thumbnail Design](../../../design/thumbnail-design.md) article.
