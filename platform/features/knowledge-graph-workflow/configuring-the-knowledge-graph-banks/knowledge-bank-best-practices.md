# Knowledge Bank Best Practices

To configure and create the best Knowledge Banks for your Agents, follow the below best practices.

* PDF content should include as much text as possible - the LLM is not good at reading tables of data and it can't read images/infographics.
* When uploading content, review the value of the content and establish the value end-users will get from it. If its not valuable, don't add it.
* The length of the content does not matter as it will be segmented.
* Ensure the processing of videos includes titles for each segment and that these titles make sense. The system will produce AI-generated titles but sometimes they need tweaking.
* We recommend always adding a thumbnail image - this helps end-users understand the content topic and decide whether they want to engage.
