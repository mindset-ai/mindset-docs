# How to create Speakers

Speakers are a way of showing end-users who is involved in a video inside a knowledge bank. By including their name and a URL link, end-users can learn more about the individual if they wanted to.

Within Knowledge Banks, any video content (mp3/4 or mov.) can have speakers assigned to the audio. When processing a piece of Content you can directly add speakers there, once added to your content go to **Knowledge > People and yo**u will see a list of **Speakers.**

Within the list of speakers, you can edit their profile by selecting the three dots by their name, followed by 'edit'.

You can add a profile URL (LinkedIn, social, or other website URL) for this person. When users are engaging with the agent, relevant speakers related to the suggested content segments will show and link to any associated Profile URLs.
