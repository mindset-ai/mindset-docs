# How to process SCORM files

You can upload SCORM files to your Knowledge Bank by processing them as a video in either MP3 or MP4 format. The information in these files can be utilized to help answer end-user questions through the Agent.

Mindset AI offers a professional service to convert from SCORM to MP3/4, if you are interested in this please contact your customer success representative.\


Note: processing SCORM files enables an Agent to be trained on this content. Files in the platform will not be traditionally interactive but will be visible to end users as a video player.
