# Learn about Synced Knowledge Banks



A **Synced Bank** has no 'upload' area, instead, this bank will show any integrated content from your chosen source. These banks will contain any content sourced from an integration such as Google Drive or Sharepoint.&#x20;

If content is ingested into a Synced Bank, any changes you make to the content at source, will be reflected in the knowledge bank. Remember: this also means that if content is deleted at source, it will be deleted from the knowledge bank too.

Files cannot be directly deleted from a synced bank, in order to delete a file, you must delete it at source.&#x20;

Inside synced banks, edits can be made to the metadata of the files such as display name, description, and summary. Any changes made to the metadata will be honored during the syncing process. &#x20;

Under the **Manage** tab of the left-hand navigation bar, go to the **Knowledge** section, here you will be able to configure the **Banks** for your agents.  From the drop down you will see **New Synced Bank.**
