# How to exclude content from being visible

Once you have uploaded a piece of content into your Knowledge Bank, you have the option to exclude the content item from the Content Discovery player and segments panel in the Knowledge Graph workflow.&#x20;

\
To do this, select the content item from your Knowledge bank, and click ‘Edit’

Next, under Content Item Settings, scroll down to the ‘Exclude from Discovery and Segments panel’ toggle. Toggle this on if you would like to exclude the content item from Discovery and segments.&#x20;
