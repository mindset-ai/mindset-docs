# Prompts

A "Prompt" refers to the input given to a model to generate a response. It can be a single sentence, a paragraph, or a series of statements that provide the initial context or information for the model to generate a coherent and relevant reply. The Prompt is the starting point of the conversation and influences the output generated by a model.

#### What is a Prompt library?&#x20;

A "Prompt library" is a collection of predefined prompts that users can choose from when interacting with a language model like ChatGPT. These prompts are often designed to guide the end-user in formulating queries or inputs that the model is more likely to understand and respond to effectively.

The idea is to offer users a set of suggested prompts that cover a range of topics or scenarios, making it easier for them to interact with the model and get meaningful responses. This can be particularly helpful for users who may be unsure of how to structure their queries or those looking for inspiration on what types of inputs work well with the model.

The prompts in a prompt library can be diverse, covering general topics, specific questions, or even role-playing scenarios to engage the model in a more interactive and dynamic conversation. The goal is to enhance the user experience by providing a starting point for generating effective interactions with the language model.
