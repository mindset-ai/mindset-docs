Here, a Prompt Collection can be added by giving it a name, some Prompts (separated by line), and a prompt postscript.

The Prompt Collection name outlines the name displayed to users in the prompts dialog above the prompts list. We advise to use a name that provides a unifying theme or topic that connects the individual prompts within the collection.&#x20;

An optional Prompt Postscript is attached to each Prompt sent to the assistant by the user. It serves as an additional instruction to guide the assistant in constructing the responses. For example “Explain in detail and give references from the context. Use markdown and bullet points for the key points.”&#x20;

#### How to enable prompts

Prompts can be enabled by navigating to **Manage > Agents** > Selecting the agent you wish to add prompts for > Selecting the **Tools** tab > toggling **Prompt library** on. \

**Prompt library for End-Users**

End-Users will see the Prompt library on the left-hand side of the text box within the Agent interface. Clicking this will open the full prompt library window for them to choose from, or they can type **'/**' to open the prompt window. The larger headings show the specific prompt collections, while the smaller text lists display the individual prompts within each collection.
