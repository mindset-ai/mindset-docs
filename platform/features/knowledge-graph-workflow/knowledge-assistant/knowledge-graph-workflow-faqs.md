# Knowledge Graph Workflow FAQs

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) organize data from multiple sources, capture information about entities of interest in a given domain or task (like people, places, or events), and forge connections between them.

We track people, events, and ideas, and by using AI we are on a journey to attaching skills/ capabilities/ knowledge to every person in a company's ecosystem based on their content.

This journey will enable us to attach all skills and capabilities gained by users and all skills/ capabilities that exist in experts' heads, so it is searchable and can be visualized.

We want to be able to understand the context of questions, personal language/ slang preferences, and even acronyms used by customers that only make sense to them so the AI truly understands what people need when they need it.



**What technology does this workflow use?**&#x20;

The Agent uses the latest commercially available Large Language Models (LLMs), augmented with your IP.



**Is my IP protected?**&#x20;

Yes. Your IP is our utmost priority and is protected in our vault. This vault locks in your IP via any content you upload and does not share it outside of your application. Your IP is not available to OpenAI to train their models (like ChatGPT).&#x20;

**Does it support other languages?**

The Agent can ingest any language but the content viewer will always be in the content Source language. For example, if you upload a PDF in French, the agent can speak to you in English regarding the document but the PDF viewer will show it in French.
