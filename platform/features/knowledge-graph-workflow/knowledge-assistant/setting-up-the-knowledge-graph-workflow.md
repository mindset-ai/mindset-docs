# Setting up the Content Player



&#x20;**How to set up the Knowledge Graph workflow**

Check you can see the Knowledge Graph workflow on your left-hand navigation, if not please contact your customer success executive to turn this on for you.&#x20;

#### Setting up Content Discovery

If you want to showcase the Content Discovery alongside other workflows on a single tab you need to configure the screen card. Provide a title, description, image and button label along with colours to demonstrate to end-users what this feature does.

#### Setting up the Content Player

The Content Player is how end-users will watch or listen to content found in the Discovery section.  Here you can configure the colours and overall theme of light or dark. You can also preview what it will look like on different devices.
