# ‘Trending’ carousel calculations

**What is the Trending carousel?**&#x20;

The Trending carousel in the Content Discovery Feature enables end-users to see which content items are most popular as other user’s are engaging with them.&#x20;

The content items with the highest engagement and interaction will be visible at the front of the Trending list, whilst content with lower engagement levels will be visible further along.&#x20;

\
**Where can I find the trending carousel?**&#x20;

The Trending carousel can be found in the content discovery feature of the Knowledge Workflow underneath the What's New carousel. &#x20;

**How is the trending carousel calculated in my application?**&#x20;

The trending carousel is based on the number of times a content item (video or PDF) is accessed by any user, from any interface. This means that the more users interact with a piece of content in your application, the higher it will be displayed on the 'Trending' list.

Please keep in mind that the trending section reflects user activity from the past 7-14 days.
