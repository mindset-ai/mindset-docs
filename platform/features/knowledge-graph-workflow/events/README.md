# Events

**What are Events?**

Events are a way of marketing your in-person or online conferences or workshops to encourage user sign-ups. Events is an additional feature inside the  Knowledge Graph workflow. They can help advertise and drive registration for live-stream events hosted on an external platform.



**Where can my users find Events in my application?**&#x20;

If you wish to configure Events in your application, you will need to contact your customer success representative to turn on this feature for you. Once done, you will need to assign this workflow to a navigation tab in your application’s navigation bar, in a similar way to other workflows.&#x20;



Under Design→ Navigation and Layout, you will be able to select the navigation icon you wish to configure, select Configure, and then choose Events under the ‘Workflows’ heading. Now, events will be assigned to your chosen navigation icon. &#x20;

Please see our article _‘How to set up the Knowledge Graph workflow’_ for more details on configuring your navigation bar. \


**How can I configure Events in my application?**&#x20;

In your application administration portal, you will be able to locate the “Events” tab under Configure → Knowledge. Here, you can configure Events for your application.&#x20;

Firstly, you are able to select the specific workflow colors, including icon and text colors, that you wish to be displayed on the Events screen.&#x20;

In addition to workflow colors, you can also configure the Events home screen card here, too. This includes adding in the card title, description, button label, colors and image icon.

Please note that the events home screen card will only be visible if the Events workflow is assigned alongside other workflows under the same navigation tab.

Should the Events workflow be configured on its own under a navigation tab, the home screen card will not be visible, and the workflow will fill the entire user’s screen instead.

Next, the coming soon card button can be configured. This includes adding in the button text and colour. The coming soon cards are displayed for events that don’t have an event link configured yet.&#x20;

Next, the register card button can be configured. This includes adding in the button text and colour. The register cards are displayed for events that have an event link configured.

Finally, the watch now card button can be configured. This includes adding in the button text and colour. The watch now cards are displayed for previous events. In the future this may offer other experiences for the user.

**How to add Events to my Knowledge Graph?**&#x20;

To set up an event in your Knowledge Graph, first go to Manage → Knowledge Graph in your application admin portal. Here, you will be able to see that there is a separate bank from your ‘Content bank’ called ‘Events bank’ - this is where you can add in upcoming events.

\
When selecting your Events bank, under the ‘Events’ tab, you will be able to view previously configured events, as well as being able to add in new events.&#x20;

To add an event into your events bank, simply select the ‘Add event’ button.&#x20;

This will take you to the general settings page where you can add in your event name, data, time and image.&#x20;



You can also add the label you wish to appear above the event. For example this label could read ‘Health & Safety’, if your company delivered Health & Safety events.&#x20;

**Please note:** You can add multiple events under the same label title. Multiple events under the same label title will appear as a carousel to end-users.&#x20;



In addition to this, labels will need to be created under Manage → Knowledge Graph → Labels before being able to assign an event to a label. Please note there is a new toggle when adding a label, meaning you can select if it is an event label or discovery label.



Next, a URL for your event can also be added. This will be the external link your end users will be able to follow to access your event.

Finally, the event’s metadata can be added. This is used by the Knowledge Graph language model to understand the event’s purpose. For example this could be&#x20;

‘Workshop’ if the event you are hosting is a workshop.&#x20;

Once you have assigned all of this information to an event, the event will appear in your Events bank, however it will remain unpublished until manually published. Please be aware that before publishing an event, it will not be visible to end users.&#x20;



In order to publish your event, select the three dots in the upper right corner of the event you wish to publish, and select ‘publish file’.

&#x20;

Now, your events will be visible to end users in your application.&#x20;
