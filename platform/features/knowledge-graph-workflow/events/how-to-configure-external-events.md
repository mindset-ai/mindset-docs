Under General Settings you can set up a workflow card, carousel title, and workflow colors. On the Event states tab you can choose various states for the event depending on time i.e. future, live, past event. Under Event signup you can configure the sign up text and buttons.

Please note that the events home screen card will only be visible if the Events workflow is assigned alongside other workflows under the same navigation tab.

Should the Events workflow be configured on its own under a navigation tab, the home screen card will not be visible, and the workflow will fill the entire user’s screen instead.\

When adding an External Event, you can provide a name, date, time, image, label for the carousel, and the Event URL. This is only for those events hosted outside of the platform.&#x20;
