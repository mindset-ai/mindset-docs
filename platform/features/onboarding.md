# Onboarding

**What is the Onboarding Workflow?**

This is the default workflow that runs when the user clicks “Get Started” within the app. The Onboarding workflow allows you to deliver a simple and frictionless introduction to using your app. It is where you learn more about who the user is by asking a series of questions and the app applies the relevant tags to the user as they progress through the onboarding process. The Onboarding Workflow is the first opportunity to learn from and associate tags to the end-user by asking a few questions to learn about end-users and apply tags to them from the first time they use your app.&#x20;

#### Configuring the onboarding workflow

To configure the Onboarding Workflow, click on the Onboarding tab on the left-hand side of the app and then click on the Home Page Settings tab. To enable the Onboarding widget which will appear on the home page, click on the Show home page widget for profile image toggle button. Under the Header text for home page widget for profile image, configure your text which will be displayed on the home page.\

You can add body text under the Body text for the home page widget for profile image and add the text that will show on the Button text for the home page widget for profile image.

**Configuring the reward state**

For the Reward state, under Welcome Text on first visit, configure the text that will be displayed on a user’s first visit, and under the Welcome Text on visit after one day, add the text that will be displayed on the visit after one day.

**Configuring Onboarding Survey Questions**

Click on the Survey Questions tab to add and configure Onboarding survey questions that the user will answer during the onboarding user journey. Click on the Add a question type drop-down to select the question type.

\
We always recommend starting the Onboarding process with your Terms and Conditions. This enables the end-user to access and read them prior to using the application, as well as confirm they agree. To configure this, click on the Survey questions tab and select Terms and Conditions from the Add a question type dropdown.

\
Add a heading text under the Heading field. Add a supporting body message under the Body field. Add a button text to accept and continue the terms and conditions under the Button text. Under the Hero Image, click on the Upload Image to add an SVG image to display in the middle of the screen. Remember to click on the Save button at the top right corner of the application.

\
For Text question type, this is best utilised as a means of finding out an end-users name. To do this, add the question text to the Primary question field. Add a message to the Supporting message field and a hint text to support the end-user in answering the question.  Click on Select Question Field to choose the Friendly Name dataset. ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/z9CaQg8xH1Kre\_T57yhc4svOrrgkVaQZmiDHNh7caHkgiqHfbivodc0s2xR1eLqLrWNP\_bHe9\_6ZX0DyMItyNskFj7PMkeeM7uaw9bpSPqtcUpsWFiWznSaKczPRvJdtaBcao0PNZZLnqFiMZqykVnE)

You then have the choice to add as many (or few!) survey-type questions. These are great to find out more about your end-users, why they are using the app, and what they are interested in. To configure this add a text to the Primary question field to set your primary question. Add a message to the Supporting message field.

\
Click on the drop-down to select how many answers a user can select from the options you provide. Add text to the answer option field to add the answer option and click on the Assign a tag button to assign tags to the question (note- you must create these tags prior to configuring the questions). You can add more questions by clicking on the Add new button. Remember to click on the Save button at the top right-hand corner of the application.
