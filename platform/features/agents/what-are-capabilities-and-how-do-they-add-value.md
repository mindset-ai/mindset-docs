# What are Capabilities?

#### What are Capabilities?&#x20;

Capabilities are pre-established paths of actions that agents can follow in a logical sequence to accomplish specific tasks. They are designed to enhance the user experience by streamlining the process of defining agent behavior, making it easier for users to interact with agents without prior knowledge of their functions. Capabilities allow agents to be more human-like in their interactions, offering a more intuitive and engaging user experience.\

Capabilities add value by streamlining the process of defining agent behavior, making it more intuitive and efficient. They allow users to see a list of actions an agent can perform and initiate the appropriate one. This not only improves the user experience but also empowers the agent to be more specific and focused in its tasks, which can lead to better performance and outcomes.
