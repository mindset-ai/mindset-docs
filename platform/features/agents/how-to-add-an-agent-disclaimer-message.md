# How to add an Agent disclaimer message

The purpose of an Agent disclaimer message is to appear in the Agent interface to remind end-users that whilst they are engaging with an Agent, it is still AI and they should double-check any facts.

When configuring this disclaimer, note it is a platform-wide configuration meaning it is the same message for all Agents. In the application administrator portal go to **Configure > Agents > General Settings** tab.

Scroll down to the Agent disclaimer section and you can see a toggle to turn it on or off platform-wide, as well as a free text field for the message itself. Toggle this on and type your message so it appears in the Agent interface.

From an end-user perspective, the message appears underneath the Agent text box, like below.
