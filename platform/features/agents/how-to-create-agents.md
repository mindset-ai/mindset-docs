# How to Create Agents

**Adding an Agent**

In order to add a new agent in your application, you will first need to be in the administration portal. Locate the 'Agents' tab in your left hand navigation bar under **'Manage'.**&#x20;

When agents have been created, you'll find a comprehensive list of your previously configured ones along with their corresponding handles displayed here.

For instance, within this application, the agents named Michelle and Angie have been set up. Their respective handles, @Michelle and @Angie, are visible in the list under the '**Agents**' tab.

To initiate the creation of a new agent, select the '**add an agent**' button.

Each agent represents a specific use case and purpose. Often, an agent can be built for a task or role. They can provide answers to any queries, if they have been connected to the right data sources, and execute tasks that align with their role.

#### Setting up your agent

After clicking the '**Add an agent**' button, you'll gain access to configuring the agent according to your preferences.

**Test**&#x20;

Under the 'test' tab, you can practice trialling out your agent to see how it responds to questions asked. We recommend you take your time testing your agent here prior to sharing it with your end-users, to ensure it is performing correctly.

#### General Settings

Next, under the 'General Settings' tab, you can add in the agent name, handle, and a brief agent description. Under this tab you can also control the agent visibility. This includes enabling access to the agent for users.&#x20;

_**Please note:**_ toggling this button on will enable your end-users to see and interact with the agent created, in the front-end of the application. We recommend that all the agent configuration and testing has been completed prior to enabling its access to end-users.&#x20;

#### Behaviour

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-05-30 at 12.20.58.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Following this, you can begin setting up the agent's behaviour within the 'Behaviour' tab. Here, you're able to input behaviour instructions including the agent's purpose, personality, policy regulations, output formatting, and any additional information that may assist the agent in answering questions effectively and efficiently.

You can also add in the interaction processes for your agent. These include an icebreaker message, process steps, and completions steps.&#x20;

_**Please note:**_ You can find more information about each of these by either clicking the small question mark icon next to the headings, or alternatively clicking [here](https://docs.mindset.ai/platform/features/agents/how-to-configure-agents).



#### Tools

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-05-30 at 12.24.52.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the next step of agent configuration, you'll choose the tools you want the agent to utilise when answering end-users questions, within the 'Tools' tab.

Here, you have the option to decide if you want the agent to utilise the clarification tool and prompt library.&#x20;

Further details about these functionalities can be found [here](https://docs.mindset.ai/platform/features/agents/how-to-configure-agents).&#x20;

Lastly, you can choose additional response details that the agent will incorporate when answering user inquiries.This includes including whether to display segments, topics, and speakers to the user.&#x20;

_**Please note:**_ You do not have to select all 3 of these features together for the same agent.&#x20;

#### Capabilities

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-05-30 at 12.25.38.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next you can set up your agent capabilities under the 'capabilities' heading. An agent capability is a specific set of steps that this agent is able to perform to the user. In order to find out more about capability configuration for your agents, please read our 'capabilities' article [here](how-to-configure-capabilities.md).&#x20;

#### Design

Under the Design tab, the agent's primary colour and text colour can be configured.

To change the colour simply click the 'select colour' button and choose your colour from the colour wheel or from your designated colour library.

#### Knowledge&#x20;

Under the '**Knowledge**' tab, you can select the knowledge banks that the agent can have access to.&#x20;

_**Please note:**_ The agent can have access to the information from multiple knowledge banks. More than one knowledge bank can be selected here.&#x20;

Once the selected knowledge banks have been toggled on and saved, the agent will then be able to utilise all information from those associated banks when answering end-user questions.&#x20;

**Access Management**&#x20;

The **Access** tab allows you to choose which of your accounts have access to the selected agent.&#x20;

The agent can either be configured with **open access** - where all application members are able to view and search published content, including users who are members of any account; or **restricted access**, where only members of selected accounts are able to view and search published content in the knowledge bank.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/summit10 2024-06-19 20-54-38.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To restrict access to your agent to specific accounts, select the '**restricted access**' button and click save.&#x20;

Next, you can select from your list of accounts below, the ones you wish to have access to the selected agent. To do this, toggle on the button next to the account you wish to grant access to the agent, and click save.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/summit10 2024-06-19 20-56-41.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can additionally grant access to all of you accounts in one go by selecting the '**grant access to all**' button, or revoke access for all accounts in one go by selecting the '**revoke access for all**' button.

_**Please note:**_ The default Knowledge bank in your application will always be an '**open access content bank'**.&#x20;

The **People** tab will show you all of the speakers you have added. \
