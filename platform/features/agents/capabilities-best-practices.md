# Capabilities Best Practices

Here are some **best practices** for configuring **capabilities** to ensure your **agent** is powerful and effective:\
\
**Define Clear Objectives**: Understand the specific tasks or functions you want your agent to perform. This clarity will guide the capabilities you choose to implement.

**Start with Essential Capabilities**: Begin by configuring the core capabilities that are crucial for your agent's primary functions. Avoid overwhelming the agent with too many capabilities at once.

**Test for Alignment**: Ensure that the capabilities align with your policy rules and the agent's intended purpose to avoid conflicts or misalignment.

**Use Specific Language**: When configuring capabilities, use clear and specific language. This helps the agent understand and execute tasks more accurately.

**First-Person Configuration**: Configure your agent using the first person when appropriate, as if the agent is speaking about itself.

**Consider the End User**: When referencing the end user, use terms like "the user" or "me" to maintain clarity in the agent's interactions.

**Iterative Improvement**: Continuously refine capabilities by engaging with the agent and testing the capabilities. This iterative process helps improve the agent's performance over time.

**Document Changes**: Keep a record of changes made to capabilities, including the reasons for changes and the outcomes. This documentation can be valuable for troubleshooting and future enhancements.

By following these best practices, you can create a more powerful and specific agent that is better equipped to handle the tasks it's designed for.&#x20;
