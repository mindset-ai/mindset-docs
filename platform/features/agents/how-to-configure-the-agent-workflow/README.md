# How to configure the Agent workflow

To configure the Agent workflow go to **Configure > Agents > General settings** to set up the workflow.

### Salutation

Configure an initial Salutation and message, this will only appear with the Agent selector screen (when more than one Agent is available to a user).

### Agent Disclaimer

The Agent disclaimer allows you to configure a friendly message that appears at the bottom of the Agent interface to remind end-users they are engaging with an AI Agent.

Read [How to add an Agent Disclaimer message](https://docs.mindset.ai/platform/features/agents/how-to-add-an-agent-disclaimer-message).

### Agent selector workflow card

Configure exactly how you want the Agent workflow card to appear to end-users by changing the Title, Description, Button, Colors, and Image. Note this only appears when more than 1 workflow is showing on a Navigation tab.&#x20;

### Global Agent Configuration

For configuration across all Agents, there are 3 options which can be toggled on or off:

* Hide Insights
* Automatically convert US to UK spelling&#x20;
* Automatically obfuscated offensive words
