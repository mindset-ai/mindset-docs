# LLM (Beta)

Under the 'LLM (Beta)' tab in the agent configuration, administrators can select the Large Language Model (LLM) that best aligns with the agentâ€™s objectives. The selected model will dictate the agent's responses to user queries.

Large Language Models are AI systems that understand and generate human language, enabling tasks like text generation, question answering, and translation in a specific way.&#x20;

Currently, you can select from the following LLM options: Mindset Recommended, GPT4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3 Sonnet, or Llama 3.1 405B Chat. Brief descriptions of each LLM can be found below their respective labels in the 'LLM (Beta)' tab.

We advise you to first trial each of these models in the 'Preview' tab to evaluate their performance and ensure satisfaction with the generated response outputs.
