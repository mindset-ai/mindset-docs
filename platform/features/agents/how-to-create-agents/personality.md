# Personality

The "Personality" options set the tone and style of interaction for the Agent. It's crucial for determining how users perceive the Agent's friendliness, professionalism, and approachability. A clearly defined personality ensures a cohesive user experience that matches the brand's voice and meets the audience's expectations.

There are 4 predefined personalities you can choose from for any agent. These personalities are based on our own best practices and offer a safe and simple way to define your agents personality, trouble-free.

If you find that the predefined personalities do not match your needs or don't go far enough, you can select the custom personality option and define your own. These can be selected under the 'Personality' tab of your agent configuration.&#x20;

The "Output Formatting" section determines how the Agent's responses appear to users. It covers language use, formatting (such as bullet points or paragraphs), and including visuals or links when needed. Good output formatting improves readability, clarity, and the user experience.&#x20;

You can also choose from the pre-configured output formatting options under the 'output formatting' section in the Personality tab of your agent configuration.

The Icebreaker Message is the initial prompt sent to the Agent, instructing it on how to begin interactions with users. This message is crucial for setting the interaction's tone, providing the Agent with guidance on introducing itself, stating its purpose, and inviting user engagement in a concise manner. The goal is to create a welcoming environment that encourages users to start their inquiry or discussion.

**Best Practices**

* **Clear Instructions:** Provide the Agent with straightforward instructions on greeting the user, introducing itself, and stating its purpose.
* **Conciseness:** Ensure the message is brief yet informative enough to guide the Agent without overwhelming the user.
* **Engagement:** Include a prompt that invites the user to engage, such as asking how the Agent can assist.

**Examples**

**1. Customer Support Agent Instruction**

```plaintext
Greet the user warmly, and introduce yourself as a Customer Support Agent designed 
to assist with inquiries and issues, and ask how you can help them today.
```

**2. Policy Explanation Agent Instruction**

```plaintext
Begin by welcoming the user, then explain that you are here to provide clear 
explanations of policies and procedures. Prompt the user to specify the policy 
the information they are seeking.
```
