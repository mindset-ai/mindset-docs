# Access

A user's access to content within a knowledge bank is managed through their entitlement to use agents. Agents can be set to **Open access** where all application users will have access to the agent and any knowledge banks the agent has access to, or can be set to **Restricted access** where only specific accounts and their members can access the agent and related content.&#x20;

#### Open Access Agents

Agents that are set to open access and the knowledge banks they are assigned are available to all users of the application. These agents should never have access to premium content, account-specific, or customer-specific content. They must have access to at least one knowledge bank and should have access to enough content to be able to perform their required task.

#### Restricted Access Agents

Agents that are set to restricted access and the knowledge banks they are assigned are only available to the users of specified accounts. The knowledge banks they have available could include the same content as open agents, but contain richer configurations or more capabilities and could also have access to premium or customer-specific knowledge banks.

To restrict access to your agent to specific accounts, select the '**restricted access**' button and click save.&#x20;

Next, you can select from your list of accounts below, the ones you wish to have access to the selected agent. To do this, toggle on the button next to the account you wish to grant access to the agent, and click save.&#x20;

You can additionally grant access to all of you accounts in one go by selecting the '**grant access to all**' button, or revoke access for all accounts in one go by selecting the '**revoke access for all**' button.
