# Knowledge

The Knowledge tab within an Agent shows the available knowledge banks within your platform. You can choose to toggle on the relevant banks related to your Agent configuration and use case.

Note that a user's access to content within a knowledge bank is managed through their entitlement to use agents.&#x20;

In the example above, the user depicted can access all three agents and will be able to find content from all five knowledge banks in the content discovery feature if enabled.

If the user was only a member of Account A, they would not be able to access Agent III or content from Knowledge Bank 5. Note that responses from Agent I will only be drawn from Knowledge Banks 1 and 2, even though the user is entitled to Knowledge Banks 3 and 4 through Agent II.

### Configuring Knowledge

To configure the Knowledge Banks select the banks that the agent can have access to.&#x20;

_**Please note:**_ The agent can have access to the information from multiple knowledge banks. More than one knowledge bank can be selected here.&#x20;

Once the selected knowledge banks have been toggled on and saved, the agent will then be able to utilize all information from those associated banks when answering end-user questions.&#x20;
