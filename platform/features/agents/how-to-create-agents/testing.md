# Testing

The Testing section allows you to compare Agent configuration via the responses to a specific prompt. This tab is optional to help test your Agent configuration.

Under the **Testing** heading, you will see the test case title. Test cases are prompts or messages directed at the agent that you want to compare between two different agent configurations. In this box, write your prompts or messages, using a new line for each prompt or question. Once you are satisfied with your entries, click save.

**Run tests:** Next, navigate to the Run Tests heading and click the 'Run Tests' button above your prompts/messages. This will test the messages against the current agent configuration. For example, if you're using Bob, the well-being agent, the prompts will be tested for Bob. A response will be generated for each saved prompt. Please note that in this alpha release, you'll need to click on the blue text response to view the agent's full reply.

With the responses from the test now available, you can proceed to run comparisons.

**Run comparisons:** Finally, under the 'Run Comparisons' heading, you can compare the agent responses to your selected prompts and messages with those from another pre-configured agent in your application. Please note that currently, you can only compare responses with one other agent at a time. To perform the comparison, select which other agent you would like to compare and then click the 'Run Tests' button under the 'Run Comparisons' heading.

You have now successfully compared responses between two agents.&#x20;
