# Settings

The **Settings** tab, allows you to add basic details about your Agent. Including:

* **Agent name**, **Agent handle**, and **Agent description** are used for identification and display to help you and your users recognize the agent. Both **handle** and **description** can be visible to users of your application.
* **Agent purpose** is a very important field and has a significant impact on the way your agent will behave, how it will interpret questions, and how it will structure answers.

#### Purpose

The **Purpose** field outlines the main role or function of the Agent. This could range from customer support, providing information, facilitating transactions, to entertaining users.&#x20;

Defining the purpose is critical because it guides the overall design of the Agent, including its interactions, responses, and the specific needs it addresses for its users.

#### Best Practices

* **Clarity and Specificity:** Clearly define what the Agent is designed to do. A specific purpose enables targeted interactions that meet user expectations.
* **User-Centric:** The purpose should focus on addressing the needs or solving the problems of its users. Understanding your target audience can help tailor the Agentâ€™s purpose to their requirements.
* **Feasibility:** Ensure the purpose aligns with what is technologically possible and practical within your resources and constraints.

**Examples**

#### Visibility

Toggling this button on will enable your end-users to see and interact with the agent created, in the front-end of the application. We recommend that all the agent configuration and testing be completed prior to enabling its access to end users.&#x20;
