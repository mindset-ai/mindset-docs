# Manually adding end-users to a Facilitation

You can add as many email addresses here as you wish. Please note: these individuals donâ€™t have to be registered users of the application. Please separate user's emails with a comma.&#x20;

Once you have added the email addresses of all the users you would like to access the facilitation, click 'add' and then click 'next'.&#x20;

You can then select whether you wish to notify those attendees about the facilitation via email.&#x20;

If you do decide to notify these users via email, you can set up the email subject and add a personalized message below. This message will be included in the email for the attendees to receive with their facilitation invite.

You can see the email preview on the right-hand side. Once done, hit save and it will send the invite to that end-user.



Once added you can view all attendees under the Facilitation attendees section by scrolling or searching their names.
