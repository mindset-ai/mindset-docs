# What are channels and how can I get value from them?

Channels allow app or account level announcements to be sent to the end-users. The broadcast channel displays all engagements that have been published. The channels workflow enables the creation of channels within your app. We have 2 types of channels - a chat channel which enables a 1:1 chat between an end-user and an account admin and a broadcast channel which allows app or account level announcements to be sent to the end-users.&#x20;



As an app or account Admin, you can view and manage engagements published to the Broadcast Channels and are able to publish an engagement using the menu of the Broadcast Channel card. You can view the engagementâ€™s details, the copy type, the availability status, the availability schedule, and basic insights.&#x20;
