# Restrictive Tags

To create and configure **Restrictive Tags**, navigate to the **“Tags” page** of the “Manage” section, then click on the **“Restrictive tags”** tab. There you will see a list of already existing Restrictive Tags. Click on the **“Add a Restrictive tag” button** to create a new tag or click on the **“●●●” icon,** against an existing tag, then click **“Edit”** to edit its configuration.&#x20;

In the configuration interface, you will be able to add a **name** and an **optional icon** for the Restrictive Tag. Use a unique and meaningful name to ensure easier management of content. Just like with General Tags only the tag icon will be visible to end-users.

**The value of Restrictive Tags**

Restrictive Tags give the ability to ensure a totally unique experience is enabled and allows us to have more control and be directive with the delivery of content to end-users. This means as Administrators you can therefore segment your end-users visibility further than AI-generated tagging.

Please see two example scenarios below where Restrictive Tags would be valuable.

#### Scenario 1:

You want to segment content delivery based on users’ proficiency with a certain topic. For example, you want beginners to receive only beginner level content, intermediate - intermediate and experts - expert-level content. You could create a “Beginner”, “Intermediate” and “Expert” Restrictive Tags; assign them to your content; then run a survey engagement to tag users based on their scores. The platform engine will then take care of the rest by matching each user with the content relevant to them

#### Scenario 2:

You want some of the content to be available only to users who have a registered account. Create a “Registered” Restrictive Tag and assign it to users with verified email addresses.
