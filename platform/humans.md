# Humans

Humans are all the end-users that have personal accounts inside an application. Humans can be assigned varying roles inside of the application, such as application administrator and account administrator.

To view and configure the Humans on your app, simply click on the “Humans” tab on the left-hand navigation bar. Here you will be able to see a list of all humans and have the ability to click into them to see more detailed information.

Note: Humans cannot be created by an administrator inside of an application, end-users must create their own personal accounts and verify using their email address.
