# Connecting a BI tool

As part of the platform, there is access to a BI tool (ThoughtSpot) to review and analyze data. But if you do want to connect your own BI tool into the database - BigQuery, such as PowerBI please contact Customer Success to arrange your data key. We can work with you to connect the two systems so you have access to your live data at all times, seamlessly.&#x20;
