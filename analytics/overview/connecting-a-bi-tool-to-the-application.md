# How do I connect my own BI tool to the data?

As part of your application, you do have access to a BI tool within your application so you can review and analyse data. But if you do want to connect your own BI tool into our database - BigQuery, please contact customer success to arrange your data key. We can work with you to connect the two systems so you have access to your live data at all times.
