# Overview

Mindset AI utilises the Business Intelligence (BI) Tool, ThoughtSpot, to obtain valuable, data-driven analytics and insights for customers.&#x20;



The software, which is embedded into the Mindset platform, facilitates the identification of critical insights, aiding individuals in understanding how end-users engage with the customerâ€™s applications.&#x20;



Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI), ThoughtSpot enables customers not only to deepen their understanding of end-user activity but also to extract valuable data from these interactions. With this data, users can create meaningful visualisations and, most importantly, make informed, actionable decisions driven by data.
