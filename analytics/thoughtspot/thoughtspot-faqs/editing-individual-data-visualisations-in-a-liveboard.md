Along the top of your screen, you will see a search bar. This shows the components that make up the visualization, also known as “search phrases”. There are boxes around each search phrase, so you can easily see where it begins and ends. Your search phrases still appear as text when you are typing, but whenever you click out of the search bar, they are boxed. Measures are green, attributes are blue, and filters are grey.&#x20;

\
You can add measures, attributes, dates, and formulas to your data visualization by selecting the desired boxes from the left-hand panel. You can filter these columns by popularity, category, and alphabetical order. Once you have selected your columns, these will appear in the search bar at the top of the screen, select ‘Go’ and the changes will be applied to your visualization.

**Filtering of values**&#x20;

Whilst creating your visualization, you can start to filter by values you’re interested in.

When selecting a measure, attribute, or date from the left-hand side, by clicking on a component you will see a filter icon appear. Click on the filter icon to filter values.\
