**What is ThoughtSpot?**

ThoughtSpot is a powerful and advanced Business Intelligence (BI) tool embedded into the  Mindset AI platform. The software enables you to gain critical insights into how your end-users are engaging with your application. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI), ThoughtSpot enables you not only to deepen your understanding of your end-users but also to extract valuable data from their interactions. With this data, users can create meaningful visualizations and, most importantly, make informed, actionable decisions driven by data.



**Terminology**

**Liveboard** - This is a collection of related answers, or search results, that appear as tables or visualizations.

**Visualization** - This is a visual representation of data. In ThoughtSpot, it is the representation of an answer. In some cases, we use the terms visualization and answer interchangeably.



**Where can it be found?**&#x20;

You can locate your ThoughtSpot liveboards in the administration portal of your application. Go to Manage â†’ Dashboard on the left-hand navigation bar and there you will be able to view data insights.&#x20;



**How can it be used to add value to your application?**&#x20;

ThoughtSpot is a highly sophisticated software platform that enables you to create meaningful data reports and beautiful visualizations. With its intuitive, user-friendly interface, you can generate, view, and export your data with ease and efficiency.



**How can you share data?**&#x20;

ThoughtSpot makes it very simple for you to export and share your data where you choose. To download a liveboard, first simply click the three dots in the top right corner and select **Download PDF**.
