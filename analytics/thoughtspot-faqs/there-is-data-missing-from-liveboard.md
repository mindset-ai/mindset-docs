# There is data missing from liveboard

It is rare that data may be missing from your ThoughtSpot account, however, if this is something that you notice, there are a few suggestions we recommend you try.



**Troubleshooting**&#x20;

Please read through the following questions carefully and ensure that you have followed these steps.&#x20;

* Have you ensured you have selected the correct liveboard for the data you are looking for.&#x20;
* Have you ensured that the correct filters have been applied for the data you expect to see



**Raising a ticket**

It may be that the troubleshooting tips above are still not returning the data that you are looking for. Should this be the case, we would kindly ask you to create a support ticket outlining the issue you are facing.&#x20;

To do this, go to your Mindset Service Portal account: [https://mindset-ai.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1](https://mindset-ai.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1) , underneath ‘Contact Us About’, select General and then select the type of support you require.&#x20;

\
One of our team will then get in touch with you as soon as possible to both identify and resolve the issue.&#x20;
